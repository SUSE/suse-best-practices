== Architecture

Getting a large-scale cloud environment right is a complex task. 
This chapter's purpose is to paint the bigger picture of all the
factors you need to consider. After an introduction into the
principle of the economy of scale, this chapter outlines the main components 
of an OpenStack cloud and how these work together. A special focus is laid 
on designing a resilient and stable scale-out setup along with its individual 
layers and the needed considerations. Lastly, a typical OpenStack 
architecture is shown to serve as a valid example.

In general, cloud platforms have a complex design and still allow for large 
scalability. But what does scalability in cloud environments mean?

=== Scalability in Clouds

Scalability is a word that most administrators are familiar with. 
However, a lot of different definitions of scalability exist and the 
word is often used in different contexts. Therefore, it is important to
provide a definition of what scalability is for the purpose of this 
document. 

When talking about processes at scale, administrators
intend to extend the load that a specific setup can process by adding
new hardware. The way new hardware is added depends on local
conditions and can vary when looking at different setups.

Until recently, the term scalability typically was used
to refer to a process called "scale-up" or "vertical scaling". This 
describes a process in which existing hardware is extended so that it can 
handle more load. Adding more RAM to an existing server, a stronger 
CPU to a node or additional hard disks to an existing SAN storage 
appliance are typical examples for scaling up. The issue with this approach 
is that it cannot be pursued any further because of physical 
limitations. As an example, the physical server's memory banks 
with the biggest RAM modules may already be in use. This means you cannot 
expand your server's memory anymore. It may also be impossible 
to replace the CPU in a server simply because for the given CPU socket, 
when no more powerful CPUs are available. Extending SANs can also fail
as all device slots of the SAN appliance are already in use with the
largest hard disks available for this model.

Not being able to scale-up a system further used to be a large issue in 
the past. Often, the only possibility to work around the problem 
was to buy completely new, more capable hardware that would be able to 
cope with the load present. That was an expensive and not always 
successful strategy.

The opposite of the process to scale-up or vertically scale is
"scale-out" or "horizontal scaling". This approach is fundamentally 
different and assumes that there is no point in extending the existing
infrastructure by replacing individual hardware components. Instead, 
in scale-out scenarios, the idea is to add new machines to the setup 
to distribute the load more evenly to more target systems within the 
installation. This is a superior approach to scale-up
approaches because the only limiting factor is the physical space that
is available in the datacenter. Thanks to dark fibre connections and other
modern technologies, it is even possible to create new datacenter sites 
and connect those to existing sites to accommodate for seamless scale-out 
processes.

NOTE: Not all scalability approaches work for all environments. The
ability to scale-out requires the software in use to support this 
operational mode. Cloud solutions, such as OpenStack,
are built for scale-out environments and can scale in a
horizontal manner at the core of their functionality. Legacy software,
in contrast to that, may only support scale-up scenarios.

As this document is about scalability in massively scalable environments,
the best scalability approach is to scale-out (horizontal scalability).
Whenever "scalability" is mentioned in this document, it references to
scale-out processes, unless noted differently in the respective section or paragraph.

=== Cloud Computing Primer

Similar to scalability, "cloud" is also used as a technical term in 
an almost indefinite number of contexts. This document elaborates
on the architecture of large-scale cloud environments based on SUSE 
OpenStack Cloud. Therefore it is appropriate to define "cloud" and 
"cloud software" in the context of this document.

Conventional IT setups are usually a turn-key solution delivered to
the customer for a specific purpose. The customer rarely takes care of
running and operating the solution themselves. Instead, the IT service provider
does that for them. This is static and can be unsatisfying for the customer
or the service provider. 

In cloud setups, service providers become platform providers. Their
main responsibility is to run a platform whose services customers can
consume at their own discretion. In addition to running the platform and
providing resources, these providers also need to offer a way for customers to
run the services themselves. This means consuming services without having to contact
the service provider each time. The hardware that is used in 
datacenters cannot provide what it takes to offer the described functionalities
without additional software. For the purpose of this document,
"cloud software" is software that creates a bridge between the
platform or infrastructure, and the customers. This allows them to
consume the available resources as dynamically as possible. 

In summary, the following attributes can be used to define "cloud":

- Self Service portal / API access
- Network based
- Pooling of existing resources
- Consumption based metering

=== OpenStack Primer

OpenStack is the best-known open source cloud solution currently
available at the market. It is the fundamental technology for the SUSE
OpenStack Cloud product and plays an important role when building a large
scale-out cloud based on SUSE products. An OpenStack Cloud also consists
of several and important components. The following paragraphs
provide an overview of the components of an OpenStack cloud and you a
quick introduction into OpenStack and how OpenStack can help you to build
a scalable compute and storage platform.

==== The OpenStack History

The OpenStack project originally started as a joint venture between
NASA and the American hosting provider, Rackspace. NASA controllers had
found out that many of their scientists were conducting experiments for
which they ordered hardware. When their experiments were finished, often the
hardware would not be reused, while scientists in other departments were
ordering new hardware for their respective experiments. The idea behind
OpenStack was to create a tool to centrally administer an arbitrary amount
of compute resources and to allow the scientists to consume these resources.
Rackspace brought in the OpenStack Swift object storage service,
which is explained in deeper detail in chapter 4.

In 2012, NASA withdrew from OpenStack as an active contributor. Since OpenStack's
official launch in 2010, dozens of companies have decided to 
adopt OpenStack, including solutions from large system vendors such as SUSE,
as their primary cloud technology. Today, the project is stable and 
reliable, and the functionalities are constantly improved. OpenStack has become
the ideal fundament when building a large scale-out environment.

At the time of writing, OpenStack consists of more than 30 services. Not all of
them are required for a basic cloud implementation; the number of core
services is considered to be six (and even out
of those only 5 are strictly necessary). For a minimum viable cloud
setup, a few additional supporting services are also required. The
following paragraphs provide a more detailed description of the
OpenStack base services.

==== Supporting Services: RabbitMQ

OpenStack follows a strictly decentralized approach. Most OpenStack projects
(and the ones described in the following paragraphs in
particular) are not made of a single service but consist of many
small services that often run on different hosts. All these services
require a way to exchange messages between each other. Message protocols
such as the AMQP standard exist for exactly that purpose and OpenStack
is deployed along with the RabbitMQ message bus. RabbitMQ is one
of the oldest AMQP implementations and written in the Erlang programming
language. Several tools in the OpenStack universe use RabbitMQ to send
and receive messages. Every OpenStack setup needs RabbitMQ. For
better performance and redundancy, large-scale environments
usually have more than one RabbitMQ instance running. More details about
the ideal architecture of services for RabbitMQ and other services are
explained further down in this chapter.

==== Supporting Services: MariaDB

A second supporting service that is included in most OpenStack setups is MariaDB
(or its predecessor MySQL). Almost all OpenStack
services use MariaDB to store their internal metadata in a persistent
manner. As the overall number of requests to the databases is large, like RabbitMQ, 
MariaDB can be rolled out in a highly available scale-out manner in cloud environments. 
This can, for example, happen together with the Galera Multi-master replication solution.

==== Authentication & Authorization: Keystone


Keystone is the project for the OpenStack Identity service that takes care
of authenticating users by requiring them to log in to the API services and
the Graphic User Interface (GUI) with a combination of a user name and a
password. Keystone then determines what role a specific user has inside
a project (or _tenant_). All OpenStack components associate certain roles 
with certain permissions. If a user has a certain role in a project, that 
automatically entitles them to the permissions of said role for every respective 
service.

Keystone is one of the few services that only comprises of one program,
the Keystone API itself. It is capable of connecting to existing user directories 
such as LDAP or Active Directory but can also run in a stand-alone manner.

==== Operating System Image Provisioning: Glance

Glance is the project for the OpenStack Image service that stores and
administers operating system images.

Not all customers consuming cloud services are IT professionals.
They may not have the knowledge required to install an operating system 
in a newly created virtual machine (VM) in the cloud. And even IT professionals
who are using cloud services cannot go through the entire setup process for
every new VM they need to create. That would take too much time and hurt the 
principle of the economy of scale. But it also would be unnecessary. A virtual
machine inside KVM can, if spawned in a cloud environment, can be very well
controlled and is the same inside different clouds if the underlying
technology is identical.
It has hence become quite common for cloud provider to supply users with
a set of basic operating system images compatible with a given cloud.

==== Virtual Networking: Neutron

Neutron is the project for the OpenStack Networking service that implements
Software Defined Networking (SDN).

Networking is a part of modern-day clouds that shows the most obvious
differences to conventional setups. Most paradigms about networking that
are valid for legacy installations are not true in clouds and often not
even applicable. While legacy setups use technologies such as
VLAN on the hardware level, clouds use SDN
and create a virtual overlay networking level where virtual customer
networks reside. Customers can design their own virtual
network topology according to their needs, without any interaction by
the cloud provider.

Through a system  of loadable plug-ins, Neutron supports a large number of
SDN implementations such as Open vSwitch. Chapter 3 elaborates on
networking in OpenStack and Neutron in deep detail. It explains how networks for clouds 
must be designed to accommodate for the requirements of large-scale cloud
implementations.

==== Persistent VM Block-Storage: Cinder

Cinder is the project for the OpenStack Block Storage service that takes
care of splitting storage into small pieces and making it available to
VMs throughout the cloud.

Conventional setups often have a central storage appliance such as
a SAN to provide storage to virtual machines through the installation.
These devices come with several shortcomings and do not
scale the way it is required on large-scale environments. And no matter
what storage solution is in place, there still needs to be a method to
semi-automatically configure the storage from within the cloud to create
new volumes dynamically. After all, giving administrative rights to all
users in the cloud is not recommended.

Chapter 4 elaborates on Cinder and explains in deep detail how it can be
used together with the Ceph object store to provide the required storage
in a scalable manner in cloud environments.

==== Compute: Nova

Nova is the project for the OpenStack Compute service that is
the centralized administration of compute resources and virtual machines.
Nova was originally developed by the Nebula project at NASA and from which
most other projects have spawned off.

Whenever a request to start a new VM, terminate an existing VM or change a
VM is issued by a user, that request hits the Nova API component first. Nova is built of
almost a dozen different pieces taking care of individual tasks inside a
setup. That includes tasks such as the scheduling of new VMs the most
effective way (that is, answering the question "What host can and should
this virtual machine be running on?") and making sure that accessing the
virtual KVM console of a VM is possible.

Nova is a feature-rich component: Besides the standard hypervisor KVM,
it also supports solutions such as Xen, Hyper-V by Microsoft or VMware.
It has many functions that control Nova's behavior and
is one of the most mature OpenStack components.

==== A Concise GUI: Horizon

Horizon is the project for the OpenStack Dashboard service that is the
standard UI interface of OpenStack and allows concise graphical access to
all aforementioned components.

OpenStack users may rarely ever use Horizon. Clouds function on the principle of
API interfaces that commands can be sent to in a specialized format to trigger
a certain action, meaning that all components in OpenStack come with an API 
component that accepts commands based on the RESTful HTTP approach.

There are, however, some tasks where a graphical representation of the
tasks at hand is helpful and maybe even desired. Horizon is written in Django 
(a Python-based HTML version) and must be combined with a WSGI server.

=== A Perfect Design for OpenStack

To put it into a metaphor: OpenStack is like an orchestra where a whole lot
of instruments need to join forces to play a symphony. That is
even more true for large environments with huge numbers of participating
nodes. What is a good way to structure and design such a setup? How can
companies provide a platform suitable for the respective requirements in
the best and most resilient manner? The following paragraphs answer these questions.

==== Logical layers in Cloud environments

To understand how to run a resilient and stable cloud environment, it is
important to understand that a cloud comes with several layers. These layers are:

- *The hardware layer*: This layer contains all standard rack servers in
  an environment, this means devices that are not specific network
  devices or other devices such as storage appliances.

- *The network layer*: This layer contains all devices responsible for
  providing physical network connectivity inside the setup and to
  the outside. Switches, network cabling, upstream routers, and special
  devices such as VPN bridges are good examples.

- *The storage layer*: This layer represents all devices responsible for
  providing persistent storage inside the setup along with the software
  components required for that. If solutions such as Ceph are in use,
  the storage layer only represents the software required for SDN as the
  hardware is already part of the hardware layer.

- *The control layer*: This layer includes all logical components that
  belong to the cloud solution. All tools and programs in this layer
  are required for proper functionality of the system.

- *The compute layer*: This layer covers all software components on the
  compute nodes of a cloud environment.

A cloud can encounter different scenarios of issues that come with 
different severities. The two most notables categories of issues are:

- *Loss of control*: In such a scenario, existing services in the cloud
  continue to work as before, but it is impossible to control them via
  the APIs provided by the cloud. It is also impossible to start new
  services or to delete existing services.

- *Loss of functionality*: Here, not only is it impossible to control
  and steer the resources in a cloud but instead, these resources have
  become unavailable because of an outage.

When designing resilience and redundancy for large-scale environments,
it is very important to understand these different issue categories and
to understand how to avoid them.

==== Brazing for Impact: Failure Domains

An often discussed topic is the question of how to make a
cloud environment resilient and highly available. It is very
important to understand that "high availability" in the cloud context
is usually not the same as high availability in the classical meaning of
IT. Most administrators used to traditional IT setups typically
assume that the meaning for high availability for clouds is to make every host in
the cloud environment redundant. That is, however, usually not the case.
Cloud environments make a few assumptions on the applications
running inside of them. One assumption is that virtual setups are as
automated as possible. That way, it is very easy to restart a virtual
environment in case the old instance went down. Another assumption
that applications running there are _cloud-native_ and inherently resilient 
against failures of the hardware that they reside on.

Most major public cloud providers have created SLAs that sound
radical from the point of view of conventional setups. Large
public clouds are often distributed over several physical sites that providers
call _regions_. The SLAs of such setups usually contain a statement
according to which the cloud status is _up_. If a cloud is _up_, it means that
customers can in any region of a setup start a
virtual machine that is connected to a virtual network.

It must clearly be stated in the SLA that the provider of a cloud setup has no
guarantee of the availability of all hosts in a cloud setup at any time.

The focus of availability is on the control services, which are needed
to run or operate the cloud itself. OpenStack services have a stateless
design and can be easily run in an active/active manner, distributed
on several nodes.  A cluster tool like *Pacemaker* can be used to
manage the services and a load balancer in front of all and can combine the 
services and make them available for the users.
Any workload running inside the cloud cannot be taken into account. 
With the feature _compute HA_, SUSE OpenStack offers an exception.
However, it should be used only where it is required, because it 
adds complexity to the environment and makes it harder to maintain. 
It is recommended to create a dedicated zone of compute nodes, which 
provide the high availability feature. 

In all scenarios, it makes sense to define failure domains
and to ensure redundancy over these. Failure domains are often referred 
to as _availability zones_. They are similar to the aforementioned regions
but usually cover a much smaller geological area. 

The main idea behind a failure domain is to include every needed service 
into one zone. Redundancy is created by adding multiple failure domains 
to the design. The setup needs to make sure that a failure inside of a 
failure domain does not affect any service in any other failure domain. 
In addition, the function of the failed service must be taken over by another 
failure domain.

It is important that every failure domain is isolated with regard to
infrastructure like power, networking, and cooling. All services (control, compute,
networking and storage) need to be distributed over all failure domains.
The sizing needs to take into account that even if one complete failure domain
dies, enough resources need to be available to operate the cloud.

The application layer is responsible for distributing the workload over
all failure domains, so that the availability of the application is 
ensured in case of a failure inside of one failure domain. OpenStack offers
anti-affinity rules to schedule instances in different zones.

The minimum recommended amount of failure domains for large scale-out
setups based on OpenStack is three. With three failure domains in place,
a failure domain's outage can easily be compensated by the remaining
two. When planning for additional failure domains, it is important to
keep in mind how quorum works: To have quorum, the remaining parts of a
setup must have the majority of relevant nodes inside of them. For example,
with three failure domains, two failure domains would still have the
majority of relevant nodes in case one failure domain goes down. The
majority here is defined as "50% + one full instance".

image::cloudls_architectur_high_level.png[align="center",width=300]

==== The Control Layer

The control layer covers all components that ensure functionality and
the ability to control the cloud. All components of this layer must be
present and distributed evenly across the available failure domains,
namely:

- *MariaDB*: An instance of MariaDB should be running in every failure
  domain of the setup. As MariaDB clustering does not support a
  multi-master scenario out of the box, the Galera clustering solution
  can be used to ensure that all MariaDB nodes in all failure domains
  are fully functional MariaDB instances, allowing for write and read
  access. All three MariaDB instances form one database cluster in a
  scenario with three availability zones. If one zone fails, the other
  two MariaDB instances still function.

- *RabbitMQ*: RabbitMQ instances should also be present in all failure
  domains of the installation. The built-in clustering functionality of
  RabbitMQ can be used to achieve this goal and to create a RabbitMQ
  cluster that resembles the MariaDB cluster described before.

- *Load balancing*: All OpenStack services that users and 
  other components themselves are using are HTTP(S) interfaces based
  on the REST principle. In large environments, they are
  subject to a lot of load. In large-scale setups, it is required
  to use load balancers in front of the API instances to distribute the
  incoming requests evenly. This holds also true for MySQL (RabbitMQ however
  has a built-in cluster functionality and is an exception from the rule).

- *OpenStack services*: All OpenStack components and the programs
  that belong to them with the exception of `nova-compute` and
  `neutron-l3-agent` which must be running on dedicated hosts (controller
  nodes) in all failure domains. Powerful machines are
  used to run these on the same hosts together with MariaDB and
  RabbitMQ. As OpenStack is made for scale-out scenarios, there is no issue
  resulting from running these components many times simultaneously.

==== The Network Layer

The physical network is expected to be built so that it interconnects
the different failure domains of the setup and all nodes redundantly. The
external uplink is also required to be redundant. A separate node in
every failure domain should act as a network node for Neutron.
A network node ensures the cloud's external connectivity by running
the `neutron-l3-agent` API extension of Neutron.

In many setups, the dedicated network nodes also run the DHCP agent for
Open vSwitch. Note that this is a possible and a valid configuration
but not under all circumstances necessary.

OpenStack enriches the existing Open vSwitch functionality with a feature
usually called _Distributed Virtual Routing_ (DVR). In setups
using DVR, external network connectivity is moved from the dedicated
network nodes to the compute node. Each compute node runs a routing
service, which are needed by the local instances. This helps in two cases:

- Scale-out: Adding new compute nodes also adds new network capabilities.
- Failure: A failure of a compute node only effects the routing of local instances.

The routing service is independent from the central networking nodes.

Further details on the individual components of the networking layer and
the way OpenStack deals with networking are available in chapter 3 of
this document.

==== The Storage Layer

Storage is a complex topic in large-scale environments. Chapter 4 deals
with all relevant aspects of it and explains how a Software Defined
Storage (SDS) solution such as Ceph can easily satisfy a scalable setup's need
for redundant storage.

When using an SDS solution, the components must be distributed across all
failure domains so that every domain has a working storage cluster. Three 
nodes per domain are the bare minimum.
In the example of Ceph, the CRUSH hashing algorithm must also be
configured so that it stores replicas of all data in all failure domains
for every write process.

Should the Ceph Object Gateway be in use to provide for S3/Swift storage
via a RESTful interface, that service must be evenly available in all
failure domains as well. It is necessary to include these
servers in the loadbalancer setup that is in place for making the
API services redundant and resilient.

==== The Compute Layer

When designing a scalable OpenStack Setup, the Compute 
layer plays an important role. While for the control services
no massive scaling is expected, the compute layer is mostly effected by the
ongoing request of more resources.

The most important factor is to scale-out the failure domains
equally. When the setup is extended, comparable amounts of nodes should
be added to all failure domains to ensure that the setup remains balanced.

[[CPU-and-RAM-Ratio]]
When acquiring hardware for the compute layer, there is one factor that
many administrators do not consider although they should:
the required ratio of RAM and CPU cores for the expected workload. To
explain the relevance of this, think of this example: If a server
has 256 gigabytes of RAM and 16 CPU cores that split into 32 threads
with hyper-threading enabled, a possible RAM-CPU-ratio for the host is
32 VMs with one vCPU and 8 gigabytes of RAM. One could also create 16
VMs with 16 gigabytes and two vCPUs or 8 VMs with 32 gigabytes of RAM
and 4 vCPUs. The latter is a fairly common virtual hardware layout (this is
called a _flavor_) example for a general purpose VM in cloud environments.

Some workloads may be CPU-intense without the need for much RAM or
may require lots of RAM but hardly CPU power. In those cases, users
would likely want to use different flavors such as 4 CPU cores and 256
Gigabytes of RAM or 16 CPU cores and 16 gigabytes of RAM. The issue
with those is that if one VM with 4 CPU cores but 256 gigabytes of RAM
or 16 CPU cores and 16 gigabytes of RAM runs on a server, the remaining
resources on said machine are hardly useful for any other task as they
blend together and may remain unused completely.

Cloud providers need to consider the workload of a future setup in the 
best possible way and plan compute nodes according to these requirements.
If the setup to be created is a public cloud, pre-defined flavors should indicate
to customers to the desired patterns of usage. If customers do
insist on particular flavors, the cloud provider must take the hardware that
remains unused in their calculation. If the usage pattern is hard to predict, 
a mixture of different hardware kinds likely make the most
sense. It should be noted that from the operational point of view, the same
hardware class is used. This helps to reduce the effort in maintenance and spare parts.

OpenStack comes with several functions such as host aggregates
to make maintaining such platforms convenient and easy. The ratio of CPU
and RAM is generally considered 1:4 in the following examples.

[[Reference-Architecture]]
=== Reference Architecture

The following paragraphs describe a basic design reference architecture
for a large-scale SUSE OpenStack Cloud based on OpenStack and Ceph.

.High-level Reference Architecture of a large-scale deployment with 108 Compute Nodes and 36 Storage Nodes
image::cloudls_reference_arch_108.png[align="center",width=500]

==== Basic Requirements

To build a basic setup for a large-scale cloud with SUSE components, 
the following criteria must be fulfilled:

- Three failure domains (at least in different fire protection zones in the
  same datacenter, although different datacenters would be better) that
  are connected redundantly and independently from each other to power
  and networking must be available.
- OSI level 2 network hardware, spawning over the three failure domains
  to ensure connectivity. For reasons of latency and
  timing, the maximum distance between the three failure domains should
  not exceed ten kilometers.
- SUSE OpenStack Cloud must be deployed across all failure domains.
- SUSE Enterprise Storage must be deployed across all failure domains.
- SUSE Manager or a Subscription Management Tool (SMT) instance must be 
  installed to mirror all the required software repositories (including all 
  software channels and patches). This provides the setup with the latest 
  features, enhancements, and security patches.
- Adequate system management tools (as explained in chapter 5) must be
  in place and working to guarantee efficient maintainability and to
  ensure compliance and consistency.


==== SUSE OpenStack Cloud roles

SUSE OpenStack Cloud functions based on roles. By assigning a host a
certain role, it automatically also has certain software and tasks
installed and assigned to it. Four major roles exist:

- *Administration Server*: The administration server contains the 
  deployment nodes for SUSE OpenStack Cloud and SUSE Enterprise Storage. 
  It is fundamental to the deployment and management of all
  nodes and services as it hosts the required tools. The administration
  servers can also be a KVM virtual machine. The administration services 
  do not need to be redundant. A working backup and restore process is 
  sufficient to ensure the operation. The virtualization of the nodes 
  makes it easy to create snapshots and use them as a backup scenario. 

- *Controller Node Clusters*: These run the control layers of the cloud.
  SUSE OpenStack Cloud can distribute several OpenStack services onto as
  many servers as the administrator sees fit. There must be one Controller Node
  Cluster per failure domain.

- *Compute Nodes*: As many compute nodes as necessary must be present;
  how many depends on the expected workload. All compute nodes must be
  distributed over the different failure domains.

- *Storage Nodes*: Every failure domain must have a storage available.
  This example assumes that SUSE Enterprise Storage is used for this
  purpose. The minimum required number of storage nodes per
  failure domain is 3.

- *Management Nodes*: To run additional services such as Prometheus (a
  time-series database for monitoring, alerting and trending) and the ELK
  stack (Elasticsearch, Logstash, Kibana - a log collection and index
  engine), further hardware is required. At least three machines per
  failure domain should be made available for this purpose.

- *Load Balancers*: In the central network that uplinks to the setup, a load
  balancer must be installed -- this can either be an appliance or a
  Linux server running Nginx, HAProxy, or other load balancing software.
  The load balancer must be configured in a highly available manner as
  loss of functionality on this level of the setup would make the
  complete setup unreachable.

The following picture shows a minimal implementation of this reference
architecture for large-scale cloud environments. It is the ideal start
for a Proof of Concept (PoC) setup or a test environment. For the final
setup, remember to have dedicated control clusters in all 
failure domains. Note that this is in contrast to what the diagram shows.

// What picture? A.S

=== SUSE OpenStack Cloud and SUSE Enterprise Storage

The basic services of an IaaS Cloud offers Compute, Networking, and Storage 
services. SUSE OpenStack Cloud is the base for the Compute and Networking 
services. For the storage, it is recommended to use a software defined 
solution and in most cases, a Ceph-based solution is used. SUSE Enterprise 
Storage is such a Ceph-based distribution and fits perfectly to SUSE OpenStack 
Cloud.

Both products team up perfectly to build a large-scale OpenStack platform.
Certain basic design tenets such as the distribution over multiple failure
domains are integral design aspects of these solutions and implicitly included.
Both products not only help you to set up OpenStack but also to run it in an effective and
efficient way.
