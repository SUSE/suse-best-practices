            <title>About DRBD</title>

            <para>DRBD is a Linux-kernel block-level replication facility that is widely used as an
                shared-nothing cluster building block. It is included in vanilla kernels since
                2.6.33, and most distributions ship the necessary userspace utilities. Furthermore,
                many distributions have newer DRBD versions than the one included in the kernel
                package in extra packages.</para>

            <para>DRBD can replicate across multiple network protocols, and in (currently) three
                modes, from synchronous for local HA clusters, to asynchronous for pushing data to a
                disaster recovery site.</para>

            <para>DRBD is developed and supported world-wide by LINBIT <link
                    xlink:href="http://www.linbit.com"/>. That includes most distributions and
                architectures, with Service Level Agreements (SLA) levels up to 24/7 email and phone
                availability.</para>

            <title>About SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension</title>

            <para>SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension is an integrated suite of open
                source clustering technologies that enables you to implement highly available
                physical and virtual Linux clusters, and to eliminate single points of failure. It
                ensures the high availability and manageability of critical network resources
                including data, applications, and services. Thus, it helps you maintain business
                continuity, protect data integrity, and reduce unplanned downtime for your
                mission-critical Linux workloads.</para>

            <para>SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension ships with essential monitoring,
                messaging, and cluster resource management functionality (supporting failover,
                failback, and migration (load balancing) of individually managed cluster
                resources).</para>

            <para>SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension includes DRBD.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="sec.introduction">
        <title>Introduction</title>

        <para>This tech-guide describes a setup consisting of two highly available Pacemaker
            clusters in two sites, with a routed IPv4 or IPv6 connection in between. The connection
            can range from a few Mbit/sec up to 10GBit/ sec, depending on the IO load imposed on the
            cluster nodes.</para>

        <para>Various services can be distributed across the clusters. Because of latency between
            the data centers you will not be able to drive a cluster filesystem across them. But
            simply replicating the data to have a quick failover in case one site goes down is
            possible.</para>

        <para>Failover between the two sites is managed using the <emphasis role="italic">Booth
                Cluster Ticket Manager</emphasis>, which is included in the Geo Clustering for SUSE
            Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension. In addition to the two cluster sites, a
            third site is needed to run a booth Arbitrator. Arbitrators are single machines that run
            a booth instance in a special mode. As all booth instances communicate with each other,
            arbitrators help to make more reliable decisions about granting or revoking tickets.
            Arbitrators cannot hold any tickets. </para>

        <para>Lots of details will be skimmed; for example, for this technical guide it does not
            matter whether the application driving IO is SAP, an NFS server, a PostgreSQL instance,
            VMs via KVM, Apache, MySQL, or whatever else you may have in use.</para>

    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="sec.installation">
        <title>Installation Requirements</title>

        <para>You will need to have the Geo Clustering for SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability
            Extension installed on both pairs of nodes, as well as on the Arbitrator node. For a
            detailed description on how to configure the Geo cluster nodes, see the Geo Clustering
            Quick Start document included in the Geo Clustering for SUSE Linux Enterprise High
            Availability Extension documentation at <link
                xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/documentation/sle-ha-geo-12/art_ha_geo_quick/data/art_ha_geo_quick.html"
            />.</para>

        <para>It is good practice and recommended to use LVM as storage layer below DRBD. This
            facilitates quick and easy creation and online enlarging of DRBD devices.</para>

        <para>You will also need to install all the software inclusive dependencies for the services
            you want to run on all four nodes. In case you replicate Virtual Machines (VMs), these
            are typically self-contained, so you’ll just need the KVM environment like virsh on the
            cluster nodes.</para>

        <title>Cluster Architecture Overview</title>

        <para>The following image depicts a two site, four-node cluster with arrows showing the
            direction of replication, and blocks in orange showing that a DRBD device is Primary.
            There are two nodes in the local site, <emphasis role="italic">alice</emphasis> and
                <emphasis role="italic">bob</emphasis>, and two nodes in the remote site, <emphasis
                role="italic">charlie</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic"
            >daisy</emphasis>.</para>

        <para>Each site will have its own DRBD resource stack and service IP to allow independent
            migration across the cluster nodes.</para>

            </mediaobject>
        </figure>

        <para>The most important details of the cluster architecture are the following:</para>

        <itemizedlist>
            <listitem>
                <para>The local high availability setup: DRBD running in Protocol C, using IP
                    addresses in a LAN respective a cross-over connection.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>Just after activating the lower DRBD devices on one node, the dedicated
                    service IP address is started.</para>
                <para>This is not only used for the service as such, but also as a fixed point that
                    can be accessed by the upper DRBD device (in Secondary state) for
                    replication.</para>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>The upper layer DRBD runs on one node per site, and is responsible to
                    replicate the data to the other data replication site. This runs in protocol A,
                    and might have a DRBD Proxy setup in between.</para>

                <note>
                    <title>Data Compression</title>
                    <para>The DRBD Proxy buffers and optionally compresses data, from one or
                        multiple DRBD resources. Compression helps if the site interconnect is
                        slower than the summed average I/O rate of the resources. The ratio is about
                        1:4 for zlib, and up to 1:50 for lzma compression. Please see the
                            <quote>DRBD Proxy 3 Compression Considerations</quote> whitepaper on
                            <link xlink:href="http://www.linbit.com/"/> for more details.</para>
                </note>
            </listitem>
            <listitem>
                <para>On the site that should actually run the service, the upper layer DRBD gets
                    set Primary, so that the filesystem therein can be mounted and used by the
                    application.</para>

            <para>The following snippets show a basic DRBD configuration. These are bare-bones;
                performance-tuning options are not included here.</para>

            <para>All three snippets can be contained in a single resource file, for example in
