=== Preparation

On each server in your environment for {eic} and {rancher}, install {slem} {slem_version} as the operating system.
This chapter describes all recommended steps for the installation.

TIP: If you have already set up all machines and the operating system, 
skip this chapter.

* You will see a login screen and you can login with your choosen Username and password. 

=== Register your system
To bring your system up to date you need to register your system against a SUSE Manager, RMT server or direct to the SCC Portal. We will describe the process in our guide with the direct connect to the SCC. For more information please look into the {slem} documentation.

Registering the system is possible from the command line using the *transactional-update register* command. For information that goes beyond the scope of this section, refer to the inline documentation with *SUSEConnect --help*. To register {slem} with SUSE Customer Center, run *transactional-update register* as follows:
----
# transactional-update register -r REGISTRATION_CODE -e EMAIL_ADDRESS
----
To register with a local registration server, additionally provide the URL to the server:
----
# transactional-update register -r REGISTRATION_CODE -e EMAIL_ADDRESS \
--url "https://suse_register.example.com/"
----
Replace *REGISTRATION_CODE* with the registration code you received with your copy of {slem}. Replace *EMAIL_ADDRESS* with the e-mail address associated with the SUSE account you or your organization uses to manage subscriptions.
. Reboot your system to switch to the latest snapshot.
. {slem} is now registered.
You can found more information in the {slem} {slem_version} link:https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/{slem_version}/single-html/SLE-Micro-deployment/[Deployment Guide] . 

=== Update your system
Login into the system and after your system is registered you can update it with the *transactional-update* command.
----
# transactional-update
----

=== Disable automatic reboot
Per default {slem} runs a timer for *transactional-update* in the background which could automatic reboot your system. We will disable it. 

----
# systemctl --now disable transactional-update.timer
----

// Needed due to Github issue: https://github.com/rancher/rke2/issues/3710
[#metal-slem]
=== Preparation for {metallb}

If you want to use {metallb} as a Kubernetes Load Balancer, you need to make sure that the kernel modules for ip_vs are loaded correctly on boot time.
To do so, create and populate the file */etc/modules-load.d/ip_vs.conf* on each cluster node as followed:

[source, shell]
----
# cat <<EOF > /etc/modules-load.d/ip_vs.conf
ip_vs
ip_vs_rr
ip_vs_wrr
ip_vs_sh 
EOF
----
endif::[]


// To do so, create a file on each cluster node named:

// ----
// /etc/modules-load.d/ip_vs.conf
// ----

// Now, you need to add the entries for the related kernel modules:
// ----
// ip_vs
// ip_vs_rr
// ip_vs_wrr
// ip_vs_sh
// ----

// Reboot the nodes and check that the kernel modules are loaded successfully:
// ----
// # lsmod | grep ip_vs
// ----
