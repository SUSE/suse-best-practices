== Requirements

=== Hardware requirements

This chapter describes the hardware requirements for installing {di} {di_version} on RKE 2 on top of {sles} 15 SP4.
Only the AMD64/Intel 64 architecture is applicable for our use case.

====  Hardware Sizing
// TODO Ueber Formatierung als normaler Text nachdenken.

Correct hardware sizing is very important for setting up {di} {di_version} on RKE 2.

===== Development systems

* Minimal hardware requirements for a generic {di} 3 deployment:
** At least 7 nodes are needed for the Kubernetes cluster.
** Minimum sizing of the nodes needs to be as shown below:

[cols="40,.^10,15,.^10,25",options="header"]
|===
|Server Role |Count|RAM|CPU|Disk space
|Management Workstation|1|16 GiB|4|>100 GiB
|Master Node|3|16 GiB|4|>120 GiB
|Worker Node|4|32 GiB|8|>120 GiB
|===

===== Production systems

* Minimal hardware requirements for an {di} 3 deployment for production use:

** At least seven nodes are needed for the Kubernetes cluster.
** Minimum sizing of the nodes needs to be as shown below:

=== Software requirements

The following list contains the software components needed to install {di} {di_version} on RKE:

* {sles} {sles_version}

* Rancher Kubernetes Engine 2

* SAP Software Lifecycle Bridge

* {di} {di_version}

* Secure private registry for container images, for example https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/all/single-html/SBP-Private-Registry/index.html

* Access to a storage solution providing dynamically physical volumes

* If it is planned to use Vora's streaming tables checkpoint store, an S3 bucket like object store is needed 

* If it is planned to enable backup of {di} {di_version} during installation access to an S3-compatible object store is needed


=== Installation on top of {harvester}

When using {harvester} to provision the virtual machines for an {di} installation, the hardware requirements for {harvester} need to be added to the requirements of {di} described at <<Hardware Sizing>>.

==== {harvester} hardware requirements

A full list of requirements for {harvester} can be found at https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.0/install/requirements

==== Development systems

The recommended setup for a {harvester} cluster to be used for development has the following requirements:


[cols="40,.^10,15,.^10,25",options="header"]
|===
|Server Role|Count|RAM|CPU|Disk space
|Harvester Node|3|32 GiB|8|>140 GiB

Adding the hardware requirements of {di} as described in chapter <<Development systems>>,
the following hardware is required to run an {di} cluster on top of {harvester} for development:

[cols="40,.^10,15,.^10,25",options="header"]

|Server Role |Count|RAM|CPU|Disk space
|Harvester Node|3|288 GiB|72|>1360 GiB

// Harvester
// RAM,CPU, Disk space
// 96, 24, 420

// DI 
// RAM,CPU, Disk space
// 192, 48, 940

==== Production systems

The recommended setup for a {harvester} cluster to be used in production has the following requirements:

[cols="40,.^10,15,.^10,25,25",options="header"]
|===
|Server Role|Count|RAM|CPU|"Disk space"|Disk speed
|Harvester Node|3|64 GiB|16|>500 GiB|>5000 IOPs
|===

Adding the hardware requirements of {di} as described in chapter <<Production systems>>,
the following hardware is required to run an {di} cluster on top of {harvester} in production:

[cols="40,.^10,15,.^10,25",options="header"]
