== Upgrade guidance

When upgrading your SAP edge application related clusters, SUSE advices to follow the order of upgrading Rancher first, then Kubernetes and afterwards the OS.
At https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000020061 you can find some information that will help you to prepare the upgrade.

=== Upgrading {eic}

Before upgrading your {eic} instance, please make sure that the target version was release for your {rke} cluster version:
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839


Detailed instructions on how to upgrade {eic} can be found at:
https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/upgrade-edge-integration-cell-solution


To upgrade your {eic} instance, navigate to the Edge Nodes of your {break elm} UI.
Select the edge node you want to upgrade. In the Deployments view, you should see your deployed solutions and their version.

To upgrade, click on the ... and select *Upgrade* as show in the picture below:

image::SAP-EIC-Upgrade-EIC.png[title=EIC Upgrade example,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

In the next couple of steps, you will be guided through the upgrade process, including the selection of the version you want to upgrade to.
If there are dependencies between your deployments, {elm} will show you those and upgrade the dependencies as well.

image::SAP-EIC-Upgrade-Dependencies.png[title=EIC Upgrade example,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

If you skipped some versions of {eic}, it might be the case that you will need to take intermidiate steps before you can upgrade to the desired version. 
In this case, you will need to repeat the steps to upgrade {eic} until you have reached your desired version.

=== Upgrading {rke}

In this chapter we will describe how to upgrade {rke}.

IMPORTANT: It is highly recommended to upgrade one minor version after another. Furthermore you should always upgrade to the highest patch level before upgrading the minor version.


==== Upgrading {rke} using {rancher}

IMPORTANT: This is the prefered way to upgrade all {rke} clusters managed by {rancher}. 

When you deployed your {rke} cluster using {rancher}, you can also upgrade the cluster using {rancher}.
Therefore enter your *Cluster Management* view in {rancher}.

image::SAP-Edge-Cluster-Management.png[title=Cluster Management Overview,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

<?pdfpagebreak?>

Click on the burger menu of the cluster you want to upgrade and click *Edit Config*.

image::SAP-Edge-Cluster-Management-Edit.png[title=Cluster Management Edit Config,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

Scroll down to the *Cluster Configuration* section, wher you can find the field *Kubernetes Version*.

image::SAP-Edge-Cluster-Management-Edit-K8s.png[title=Upgrade Kubernetes,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

Select the Kubernetes Version you want to upgrade to and click on *Save* in the bottom right corner of your window.

==== Upgrading {rke} without {rancher}

When upgrading {rke} wihtout {rancher} there are two strategies to be considered:

1. Upgrading the existing nodes one by one
2. Adding an additional (temporary) node that already holds the upgrade

WARNING: Whatever strategy you choose, it is highly recommended to upgrade the control plane nodes before upgrading the worker nodes.
Furthermore you should upgrade one node at a time.


===== Upgrading with temporary nodes

When upgrading the cluster with temporary nodes, you'll add a new node to the cluster that already holds the upgrades.

So initially you will have a landscape like this:

image::SAP-Edge-Upgrade-init.svg[title=Upgrade RKE2 init,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

And after adding the new node, the landscape will look like this:

image::SAP-Edge-Upgrade-add-CP.svg[title=Upgrade RKE2 add,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

Once the node was added and all mandatory components have been deployed on it, another non-upgraded node can be removed from the cluster:

image::SAP-Edge-Upgrade-rm-CP.svg[title=Upgrade RKE2 rm,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

IMPORTANT: Before you remove the node from the cluster, you should cordon and drain it.
Cordoning a node will prevent new workloads to be scheduled on the node, while draining will reschedule the already running workloads.

The same procedure can be done for the upgrades of the worker nodes:

image::SAP-Edge-Upgrade-worker.svg[title=Upgrade RKE2 worker,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

===== Upgrading without temporary nodes

Before upgrading an existing node, we recommend to cordon and drain it.
To do so, run the following commands:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl cordon <node-name>
kubectl drain <node-name> --grace-period=600
----

Depending on the way you installed {rke}, the upgrade is performed differently.
For more information about the manual upgrade please refer to https://docs.rke2.io/upgrades/manual_upgrade.

IMPORTANT: Don't use another method for upgrading than you used to install.
If you installed {rke} using the RPM, you should not try to upgrade using the installation script.

In this guide we'll give you an example how to upgrade using the installation script.

To upgrade {rke} using the installation script, connect to your {rke} node and run the command below. Make sure to replace the version 
with your desired target version.

[source, bash]
----
curl -sfL https://get.rke2.io | INSTALL_RKE2_VERSION=vX.Y.Z+rke2rN sh -
----

You can find a list of {rke} versions at https://github.com/rancher/rke2/releases .

After running the script, you should wait for a minute before you restart the {rke} service.
To restart the service on a control plane node, run:

[source, bash]
----
sudo systemctl restart rke2-server
----

To restart the service on a worker node, run:

[source, bash]
----
sudo systemctl restart rke2-agent
----

After the service was restarted, you can uncordon your node, so it can be used for scheduling again:

[source, bash]
----
kubectl uncordon <node-name>
----

These steps need to be repeated for every machine of the cluster.

=== Upgrading {rancher}

IMPORTANT: We strongly recommend taking a backup before upgrading your {rancher} instance. Please refer to https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/how-to-guides/new-user-guides/backup-restore-and-disaster-recovery/back-up-rancher for further information.

A detailed overview of the upgrade process can be found at:
https://ranchermanager.docs.rancher.com/getting-started/installation-and-upgrade/install-upgrade-on-a-kubernetes-cluster/upgrades 

In this chapter we'll describe the most common upgrade path.

The first step is to update the helm repository:

[source, bash]
----
helm repo update
----

Afterwards it's recommended to take a backup of the configuration parameters of the currently Helm deployment:

[source, bash]
----
helm get values rancher -n cattle-system -o yaml > values.yaml
----

The upgrade of {rancher} is then triggered by running the command below, where you'll specify the version to upgrade to:

[source, bash]
----
helm upgrade rancher rancher-prime/rancher \
  --namespace cattle-system \
  -f values.yaml \
  --version=<desired-version>
----

# end::rancher[]


# tag::harvester[]

<?pdfpagebreak?>

=== Upgrading {harvester}

WARNING: Make sure to verify your {harvester} version is supported with your coupled {rancher} instance. You can check this at https://www.suse.com/suse-harvester/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/harvester-v1-5-x/ under *Harvester & Rancher Support Matrix*.

Before upgrading {harvester}, it is highly recommended to use the pre-check script available at https://github.com/harvester/upgrade-helpers/tree/main/pre-check/v1.x.
This will make sure that your cluster is in a healthy state and ready to be upgrade. If the check finds any issues, please make sure to fix the issue before running an upgrade.
It is not necessary to run the script on all nodes - just one is enough.

Besides running the check script, we highly recommend to check the official upgrade documentation at https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.5/upgrade/index and in particular the sections that refer the upgrade from your current version to the target version.

The upgrade itself can be easily triggered from the {harvester} UI, once an upgrade is available.
If there is an upgrade availabe, the UI will show an *Upgrade* button in the upper right corner of the Dashboard, as shown below:

image::SAP-Edge-Upgrade-Harvester-Upgrade-Button.png[title=Harvester upgrade vailable,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

If you click on the *Upgrade* button, a window will open, showing all possible target versions.

image::SAP-Edge-Upgrade-Harvester-Version.png[title=Harvester upgrade vailable,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

After selecting the target version, click on *Upgrade* again, to start the upgrade process.

=== Upgrading the OS

Depending on the operating system used, the commands and procedures for the upgrade differs.
In this guide we'll describe how to upgrade {slem}, as it's the operating system that we already used to explain how to set up your landscapes.

NOTE: If you want to familiarize with {slem} and the concept of transactional updates, we recommend to read https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/{slem_version}/html/Micro-transactional-updates/transactional-updates.html .


Before upgrading your {slem} instance, read https://documentation.suse.com/en-us/sle-micro/{slem_version}/html/Micro-upgrade/index.html .

As a {slem} upgrade is only supported from the most recent patch levels, make sure your system is up to date.
Updating {slem} can be done by running:

[source, bash]
----
sudo transactional-update patch
----

WARNING: Keep in mind that transactional-updates requires a reboot to take effect!


Upgrading {slem} can be done in a similar manner:

[source, bash]
----
sudo transactional-update migration
----
