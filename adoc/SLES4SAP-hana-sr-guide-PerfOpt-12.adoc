=== Introduction

{sles4sapreg} is optimized in various ways for {SAPreg} applications. This
guide provides detailed information about installing and customizing
{sles4sap} for {hana} system replication in the {usecase} scenario.

“{SAP} customers invest in {hana}” is the conclusion reached by a recent
market study carried out by Pierre Audoin Consultants (PAC). In Germany,
half of the companies expect {hana} to become the dominant
database platform in the {SAP} environment. Often the “{SAP}
Business Suite* powered by {hana}*” scenario is already being discussed
in concrete terms.

{SUSE} is also accommodating this development by providing {sles4sap}
– the recommended and supported operating system for {hana}. In close
collaboration with {SAP} and hardware partners, {SUSE} provides two
resource agents for customers to ensure the high availability of {hana} system
replications.

==== Abstract

This guide describes planning, setup, and basic testing of
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications based on
the high availability solution scenario
"SAP HANA Scale-Up System Replication Performance Optimized".

From the application perspective the following variants are covered:

- plain system replication

- system replication with secondary site read-enabled

- multi-tier (chained) system replication

- multi-target system replication

- multi-tenant database containers for all above

From the infrastructure perspective the following variants are covered:

- 2-node cluster with  disk-based SBD

- 3-node cluster with disk-less SBD

==== Scale-Up Versus Scale-Out

The first set of scenarios includes the architecture and development of
_scale-up_ solutions.

.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster
image::hana_sr_in_cluster.svg[scaledwidth=70.0%]

For these scenarios {SUSE} developed the scale-up
resource agent package `{SAPHanaSR}`. System replication will help to
replicate the database data from one computer to another computer to compensate for database failures (single-box replication).

//.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster
//image::hana_sr_in_cluster.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]

The second set of scenarios includes the architecture and development of
_scale-out_ solutions (multi-box replication). For these scenarios {SUSE}
developed the scale-out resource agent package `{SAPHanaSR}-ScaleOut`.

.{hana} System Replication Scale-Out in the Cluster
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Cluster.svg[scaledwidth=70.0%]

With this mode of operation, internal {hana} high availability (HA)
mechanisms and the resource agent must work together or be coordinated
with each other. {hana} system replication automation for scale-out
is described in an own document available on our documentation Web page
at {reslibrary}. The document for scale-out is named _"{docScaleOut}"_.

==== Scale-Up Scenarios and Resource Agents

{SUSE} has implemented the scale-up scenario with the `{SAPHanaRA}` resource
agent (RA), which performs the actual check of the {HANA} database
instances. This RA is configured as a master/slave resource. In the
scale-up scenario, the master assumes responsibility for the {hana}
databases running in primary mode. The slave is responsible for
instances that are operated in synchronous (secondary) status.

To make configuring the cluster as simple as possible, SUSE also
developed the `{SAPHanaTopRA}` resource agent. This RA runs on all nodes
of a {sles4sap} cluster and gathers information about the
statuses and configurations of {hana} system replications. It is
designed as a normal (stateless) clone.

{hana} System replication for Scale-Up is supported in the following
scenarios or use cases:

* *Performance optimized* (_A => B_). This scenario and setup *is
described in this document.*
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-perfOpt.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
In the performance optimized scenario an {hana} RDBMS site A is synchronizing
with an {HANA} RDBMS site B on a second node. As the HANA RDBMS on the second node
is configured to pre-load the tables, the takeover time is typically very
short.
+
One big advance of the performance optimized scenario of {hana} is the
possibility to allow read access on the secondary database site. To support
this *read enabled* scenario, a second virtual IP address is added to the cluster
and bound to the secondary role of the system replication.
* *Cost optimized* (_A => B, Q_). This scenario and setup is described
in another document available from the documentation Web page ({reslibrary}). The document for _cost optimized_ is named
_"{docCostOpt}"_.
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - cost optimized
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-costOpt2.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
In the cost optimized scenario the second node is also used for a
non-productive {hana} RDBMS system (like QAS or TST). Whenever a takeover
is needed the non-productive system must be stopped first. As the
productive secondary system on this node must be limited in using system
resources, the table preload must be switched off. A possible
takeover needs longer than in the performance optimized use case.
+
In the cost optimized scenario the secondary needs to be running in a reduced
memory consumption configuration. This why _read enabled_ must not be used in this
scenario.
* *Multi Tier* (_A => B -> C_) and *Multi Target* (_B <= A => C_).
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized chain
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-Chain.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
A _Multi Tier_ system replication has an additional target. In the past this third
side must have been connected to the secondary (chain topology). With current {saphana}
versions also _multiple target topology_ is allowed by {sap}.
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized multi target
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-MultiTarget.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
Multi tier and multi target systems are implemented as described in this document.
Only the first replication pair (A and B) is handled by the cluster itself.
The main difference to the plain performance optimized scenario is that the auto
registration must be switched off.

* *Multi-tenancy* or MDC.
+
Multi-tenancy is supported for all above scenarios and use cases. This
scenario is supported since {hana} SPS09. The setup and configuration
from a cluster point of view is the same for multi-tenancy and single
container. Thus you can use the above documents for both kinds of
scenarios.

// TODO PRIO1: Add new restrictions here (think about multi target, handshake, ...)

==== The Concept of the Performance Optimized Scenario

In case of failure of the primary {HANA} on node 1 (node or database
instance) the cluster first tries to start the takeover process. This
allows to use the already loaded data at the secondary site. Typically
the takeover is much faster than the local restart.

To achieve an automation of this resource handling process, you must
use the {hana} resource agents included in {SAPHanaSR}. System
replication of the productive database is automated with {SAPHanaRA} and
{SAPHanaTopRA}.

The cluster only allows a takeover to the secondary site if the {hana}
system replication was in sync until the point when the service of the primary
got lost. This ensures that the last commits processed on the primary site are
already available at the secondary site.

{sap} did improve the interfaces between {saphana} and external software such as
cluster frameworks. These improvements also include the implementation of {saphana}
call outs in case of special events such as status changes for services or system replication
channels. These calls outs are also called HA/DR providers. This interface can be used by
implementing {saphana} hooks written in python. {suse} improved the SAPHanaSR package
to include such {saphana} hooks to optimize the cluster interface. Using the
{saphana} hook described in this document allows to inform the cluster immediately
if the {saphana} system replication breaks. In addition to the {saphana} hook status
the cluster continues to poll the system replication status on regular base.

You can set up the level of automation by setting the parameter
`AUTOMATED_REGISTER`. If automated registration is activated, the cluster
will also automatically register a former failed primary to get the new
secondary.

IMPORTANT: The solution is not designed to manually 'migrate' the primary or
secondary instance using HAWK or any other cluster client commands. In the
_Administration_ section of this document we describe how to 'migrate' the primary to the secondary site
using {sap} and cluster commands.

==== Customers Receive Complete Package

Using the SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology resource agents, customers
are be able to integrate {hana} system replications in their
cluster. This has the advantage of enabling companies to use not only
their business-critical SAP systems but also their {hana} databases
without interruption while noticeably reducing needed budgets. SUSE
provides the extended solution together with best practices
documentation.

SAP and hardware partners who do not have their own {hana}
high availability solution will also benefit from this development from SUSE.

[[cha.hana-sr.scenario]]
== Supported Scenarios and Prerequisites

With the `SAPHanaSR` resource agent software package, we limit the
support to Scale-Up (single-box to single-box) system replication with
the following configurations and parameters:

* Two-node clusters are standard. Three node clusters are fine if you install
the resource agents also on that third node. But define in the cluster that {saphana}
resources must never run on that third node. In this case the third node is an
additional decision maker in case of cluster separation.
* The cluster must include a valid STONITH method.
** Any STONITH mechanism supported by SUSE Linux Enterprise {prodnr} High Availability Extension (like SDB, IPMI)
is supported with SAPHanaSR.
** This guide is focusing on the SBD fencing method as this is hardware
independent.
** If you use disk-based SBD as the fencing mechanism, you need one or more shared
drives. For productive environments, we recommend more than one SBD
device. For details on disk-based SBD, read the product documentation for
SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension and the manual pages
sbd.8 and stonith_sbd.8.
** For disk-less SBD you need at least three cluster nodes. The disk-less SBD mechanism
has the benefit that you do not need a shared drive for fencing.
* Both nodes are in the same network segment (layer 2). Similar methods provided
by cloud environments such as overlay IP addresses and load balancer functionality
are also fine. Follow the cloud specific guides to set up your {sles4sap} cluster.
* Technical users and groups, such as _<sid>adm_ are defined
locally in the Linux system.
* Name resolution of the cluster nodes and the virtual IP address must
be done locally on all cluster nodes.
* Time synchronization between the cluster nodes like NTP.
* Both {hana} instances (primary and secondary) have the same SAP Identifier (SID) and instance
number.
* If the cluster nodes are installed in different data centers or data
center areas, the environment must match the requirements of the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension
cluster product. Of particular concern are the network latency and
recommended maximum distance between the nodes. Review our
product documentation for SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension about those recommendations.
* Automated registration of a failed primary after takeover.
** As a good starting configuration for projects, we recommend to switch
off the automated registration of a failed primary. The setup
`AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"` is the default. In this case, you need to
register a failed primary after a takeover manually. Use SAP tools like
{saphana} cockpit or _hdbnsutil_.
** For optimal automation, we recommend `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`.
* Automated start of {hana} instances during system boot must be
switched off.
* Multi-tenancy (MDC) databases are supported.
** Multi-tenancy databases could be used in combination with any other
setup (performance based, cost optimized and multi-tier).
** In MDC configurations the SAP HANA RDBMS is treated as a single
system including all database containers. Therefore cluster takeover
decisions are based on the complete RDBMS status independent of the
status of individual database containers.
** For {hana} 1.0 you need version SPS10 rev3, SPS11 or newer if you want to stop
tenants during production and you want the cluster to be able to take over.
Older {hana} versions are marking the system replication as failed if
you stop a tenant.
** Tests on Multi-tenancy databases could force a different test procedure
if you are using strong separation of the tenants. As an example, killing the
complete {hana} instance using _HDB kill_ does not work, because the tenants are
running with different Linux user UIDs. {refsidadm} is not allowed to terminate the
processes of the other tenant users.

You need at least {SAPHanaSR} version {sapHanaSrMinVers} and in best {sles4sap} {prodnr}
{prodsp} or newer. {hana} 1.0 is supported since SPS09 (095) for all mentioned setups.
{hana} 2.0 is supported with all known SPS versions.

IMPORTANT: Without a valid STONITH method, the complete cluster is unsupported
and will not work properly.

////
// TODO: TO BE DELETED
This setup guide focuses on the performance optimized setup. No other
{hana} system (like QAS or TST) on the replicating node which needs to
be stopped during takeover is considered in this scenario.

* Cost optimized setups with a non-productive {hana} (like QAS or TST)
on the secondary node are supported. SUSE has published a setup guide
for cost optimized scenarios too ({uarr} {hana} SR Cost Optimized
Scenario). We already have a SCN article for this kind of setups:
http://scn.sap.com/docs/DOC-65899. You need to configure the {hana}
database resources at the secondary side to run them side by side (see
SAP documentation for cost optimized setups).
* Multi-tier setups (A => B -> C) are supported. You need to disable
automated re-registration (AUTOMATED_REGISTER=”false”), because SAP
currently does not allow two targets to be connected to one primary
({uarr} {hana} SR Multi Tier Scenario).
* Multi-tenancy (MDC) databases are supported.
** Multi-tenancy databases could be used in combination with any other
setup (performance based, cost optimized and multi-tier).
** In MDC configurations the SAP HANA RDBMS is treated as a single
system including all database containers. Therefore cluster takeover
decisions are based on the complete RDBMS status independent of the
status of individual containers.
** You need {hana} version >= SPS10 rev3 or SPS11+ if you need to stop
tenants during production and like the cluster to be able to takeover.
Older {hana} versions are marking the system replication as failed if
you stop a tenant.
////

If you need to implement a different scenario, we strongly recommend to
define a PoC with SUSE. This PoC will focus on testing the existing
solution in your scenario. Most of the above mentioned limitations are because
careful testing is needed.

Besides {hana}, you need SAP Host Agent to be installed on your system.

[[cha.hana-sr.scope]]
== Scope of This Documentation

This document describes how to set up the cluster to control {hana} in
System Replication Scenarios. The document focuses on the steps to
integrate an already installed and working {hana} with System
Replication.

The described example setup builds an {hana} HA cluster in two data centers in Walldorf
({sapsite1}) and in Rot ({sapsite2}), installed on two {sles4sapa}
{prodnr} {prodsp} systems.

.Cluster with {hana} SR - performance optimized
image::hana_sr_scaleup_perfopt.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]

You can either set up the cluster using the YaST wizard, doing it manually or
using your own automation.

If you like to use the YaST wizard, you can use the shortcut _yast sap_ha_ to
start the module. The procedure to set up {saphanasr} using YaST is described in
the product documentation of {sles4sap} in section _Setting Up an SAP HANA Cluster_

This guide focuses on the manual setup of the cluster to explain the details and
to give you the possibility to create your own automation.

The seven main setup steps are:

:stepPlanning: Planning the Installation
:stepOS: Operating System Setup
:stepHANA: Installing the {hana} Databases on both cluster nodes
:stepHSR: Set Up {hana} System Replication
:stepHook: Set Up {hana} HA/DR providers

- Planning (see <<{stepPlanning}>>)
- OS installation (see <<{stepOS}>>)
- Database installation (see <<{stepHANA}>>)
- {saphana} system replication setup (see <<{stepHSR}>>
- {saphana} HA/DR provider hooks (see <<{stepHook}>>)
- Cluster configuration (see <<{stepCluster}>>)
- Testing (see <<{stepTest}>>)

== {stepPlanning}

image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase1.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

Planning the installation is essential for a successful {saphana} cluster setup.

What you need before you start:

- Software from {suse}: {sles4sap} installation media, a valid subscription,
  and access to update channels
- Software from {sap}: {saphana} installation media
- Physical or virtual systems including disks
- Filled parameter sheet (see below <<Parameter Sheet>>)


=== Minimum Lab Requirements and Prerequisites

// TODO PRIO1: Define the minimum lab requirements

NOTE: The minimum lab requirements mentioned here are no SAP sizing information.
These data are provided only to rebuild the described cluster in a lab for test purposes.
Even for such tests the requirements can increase depending on your test scenario.
For productive systems ask your hardware vendor or use the official SAP sizing
tools and services.

NOTE: Refer to {saphana} TDI documentation for allowed storage
configuration and file systems.

Requirements with 1 SAP instance per site (1 : 1) - without a
majority maker (2 node cluster):

- 2 VMs with each 32GB RAM, 50GB disk space for the system
- 1 shared disk for SBD with 10 MB disk space
- 2 data disks (one per site) with a capacity of each 96GB for {saphana}
- 1 additional IP address for takeover
- 1 optional IP address for the read-enabled setup
- 1 optional IP address for HAWK Administration GUI

Requirements with 1 SAP instance per site (1 : 1) - with a
majority maker (3 node cluster):

- 2 VMs with each 32GB RAM, 50GB disk space for the system
- 1 VM with 2GB RAM, 50GB disk space for the system
- 2 data disks (one per site) with a capacity of each 96GB for {saphana}
- 1 additional IP address for takeover
- 1 optional IP address for the read-enabled setup
- 1 optional IP address for HAWK Administration GUI

// pools size is calculated like:
//     shared = 1 * MEM
//     data   = NODES * 1   * MEM
//     log    =  NODES * 1/2 * MEM
//     pool = shared + data + log

=== Parameter Sheet

Even if the setup of the cluster organizing two {saphana} sites is quite simple, the installation
should be planned properly. You should have all needed parameters like SID, IP
addresses and much more in place. It is good practice to first fill out
the parameter sheet and then begin with the installation.

== {stepOS}

image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase2.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

This section contains information you should consider during the
installation of the operating system.

For the scope of this document, first {sles4sap} is installed and configured. Then the {saphana}
database including the system replication is set up. Finally the
automation with the cluster is set up and configured.

=== Installing {sles4sap}

Multiple installation guides are already existing, with different reasons to set
up the server in a certain way. Below it is outlined where this information can
be found. In addition, you will find important details you should consider to get
a well-working system.

==== Installing Base Operating System

Depending on your infrastructure and the hardware used, you need to adapt the installation.
All supported installation methods and minimum requirement are described in the _Deployment Guide_
({deploymentGuide12}).
In case of automated installations you can find further information in the _AutoYaST Guide_
({autoYastGuide12}).
The main installation guides for {sles4sap} that fit all requirements for {sapHana} are available from the
SAP notes:

// SUSE and SAP are kept literal here not by the reference, because its a quote of an external title
- 1984787 SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 12: Installation notes and
- 2205917 SAP HANA DB: Recommended OS settings for SLES 12 / SLES for SAP Applications 12.


==== Installing Additional Software
{SUSE} delivers with {sles4sap} special resource agents for {sapHana}. With the pattern _sap-hana_ the resource
agent for {sapHana} *scale-up* is installed. For the *scale-out* scenario you need a special resource agent.
Follow the instructions below on each node if you have installed the systems based on SAP note 1984787.
The pattern _High Availability_ summarizes all tools recommended to be installed on *all* nodes, including the
_majority maker_.

// DONE PRIO1: To install HA *and* SAPHanaSR now, because we need it during the setup of SAP HANA

// To do so, for example, use zypper:

Even though this document focuses on the integration of an
installed {hana} with system replication already set up into the
pacemaker cluster, this chapter summarizes the test environment.
Always use the official documentation from SAP to install {hana} and to
set up the system replication.

=== {stepHANA}


.Preparation

* Read the SAP Installation and Setup Manuals available at the SAP Marketplace.

* Download the {hana} Software from SAP Marketplace.

.Actions

. Install the {hana} Database as described in the {hana} Server
Installation Guide.

. Check if the SAP Host Agent is installed on all cluster nodes. If this
SAP service is not installed, install it now.

. Verify that both databases are up and all processes of these databases
are running correctly.

As Linux user _<sid>adm_ use the command line tool _HDB_ to get an
overview of running HANA processes. The output of `HDB` `info` should
be similar to the output shown below:

For more information read the section _Setting Up System Replication_ of
the {hana} Administration Guide.

**Procedure**

. Back up the primary database
. Enable primary database
. Register the secondary database
. Verify the system replication

=== Back Up the Primary Database

Back up the primary database as described in the {hana} Administration
Guide, section _{hana} Database Backup and Recovery_. We provide an
example with SQL commands. You need to adapt these backup commands to match your
backup infrastructure.

.Simple backup for the system database and all tenants with one single backup call
=========================
As user {refsidadm} enter the following command:

----
hdbsql -u SYSTEM -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR FULL SYSTEM USING FILE ('backup')"
----

You get the following command output (or similar):

----
0 rows affected (overall time 15.352069 sec; server time 15.347745 sec)
----
=========================

.Simple backup for a single container (non MDC) database
=========================
Enter the following command as user {refsidadm}:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
hdbsql -i {refInst} -u <dbuser> \
   "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('backup')"
----
=========================

IMPORTANT: Without a valid backup, you cannot bring {hana} into a system
replication configuration.

=== Enable Primary Node

As Linux user _<sid>adm_ enable the system replication at the
primary node. You need to define a site name (like {sapsite1}). This
site name must be unique for all {hana} databases which are connected
via system replication. This means the secondary must have a different
site name.

NOTE: Do not use strings like "primary" and "secondary" as site names.

.Enable the Primary
==========
Enable the primary using the -sr_enable option.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name={sapsite1}
checking local nameserver:
checking for active nameserver ...
nameserver is running, proceeding ...
configuring ini files ...
successfully enabled system as primary site ...
done.
----
==========

.Check SR Configuration on the Primary
==========
Check the primary using the command `hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration`.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration --sapcontrol=1
SAPCONTROL-OK: <begin>
mode=primary
site id=1
site name={sapsite1}
SAPCONTROL-OK: <end>
done.
----
==========

The mode has changed from “none” to “primary” and the site now has a
site name and a site ID.

=== Register the Secondary Node

The {hana} database instance on the secondary side must be stopped
before the instance can be registered for the system replication. You
can use your preferred method to stop the instance (like `HDB` or
`sapcontrol`). After the database instance has been stopped
successfully, you can register the instance using `hdbnsutil`. Again,
use Linux user _<sid>adm_:

.Stop the Secondary
==========
To stop the secondary you can use the command line tool _HDB_.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode2}:~> HDB stop
----
==========

.Copy the KEY and KEY-DATA file from the primary to the secondary site
==========
Beginning with {hana} 2.0 the system replication is running encrypted. This
is why the key files needs to copied-over from the primary to the secondary
site.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
cd /usr/sap/{refSID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs
rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/data/SSFS_{refSID}.DAT
rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/key/SSFS_{refSID}.KEY
----
==========

.Register the Secondary
==========
The registration of the secondary is triggered by calling _hdbnsutil -sr_register ..._.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
...
{sapnode2}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_register --name={sapsite2} \
     --remoteHost={sapnode1} --remoteInstance={sapino} \
     --replicationMode=sync --operationMode=logreplay
adding site ...
checking for inactive nameserver ...
nameserver {sapnode2}:30001 not responding.
collecting information ...
updating local ini files ...
done.
----
==========

The _remoteHost_ is the primary node in our case, the _remoteInstance_ is
the database instance number (here {sapino}).

Now start the database instance again and verify the system replication
status. On the secondary node, the mode should be one of "SYNC" or
"SYNCMEM". "ASYNC" is also a possible replication mode *but not supported with
automated cluster takeover*. The mode depends on the *sync* option defined during
the registration of the secondary.

.Start Secondary and Check SR Configuration
==========
To start the new secondary use the command line tool _HDB_. Then check the
SR configuration using `hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration`.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode2}:~> HDB start
...
{sapnode2}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration --sapcontrol=1
SAPCONTROL-OK: <begin>
mode=sync
site id=2
site name={sapsite2}
active primary site=1
primary masters={sapnode1}
SAPCONTROL-OK: <end>
done.
----
==========


To view the replication state of the whole {hana} cluster use the
following command as _<sid>adm_ user on the primary node.

.Checking System Replication Status Details
==========
The python script _systemReplicationStatus.py_ provides details about the current
system replication.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py --sapcontrol=1
...
site/2/SITE_NAME=ROT1
site/2/SOURCE_SITE_ID=1
site/2/REPLICATION_MODE=SYNC
site/2/REPLICATION_STATUS=ACTIVE
site/1/REPLICATION_MODE=PRIMARY
site/1/SITE_NAME=WDF1
local_site_id=1
...
----
==========

=== Manual Test of SAP HANA SR Takeover

Before you integrate your SAP HANA system replication into the cluster
it is mandatory to do a manual takeover. Testing without the cluster helps to make sure that
basic operation (takeover and registration) is working as expected.

* Stop {hana} on node 1

* Takeover {hana} to node 2

* Register node 1 as secondary

* Start {hana} on node 1

* Wait till sync state is active

=== Optional: Manually Re-Establishing of SAP HANA SR to Original State

Bring the systems back to the original state:

* Stop {hana} on node 2

* Takeover {hana} to node 1

* Register node 2 as secondary

* Start {hana} on node2

* Wait until sync state is active

== {stepHook}

image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase5.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

// DONE: Feedback ps: explain better, when the python hook is needed.

This step is mandatory to inform the cluster immediately if the secondary gets out of sync.
The hook is called by {SAPHANA} using the HA/DR provider interface in point-of-time when the secondary gets out of
sync. This is typically the case when the first commit pending is released. The hook is
called by {SAPHANA} again when the system replication is back.

**Procedure**

. Implement the python hook SAPHanaSR
. Configure system replication operation mode
. Allow {refsidadm} to access the cluster
. Start {saphana}
. Test the hook integration

// TODO PRIO2: Steps "Start" and "Test" are missing

=== Implementing the Python Hook SAPHanaSR

This step must be done on both sites. {SAPHANA} must be stopped to change the
global.ini and allow {SAPHANA} to integrate the HA/DR hook script during start.

- Install the HA/DR hook script into a read/writable directory
- Integrate the hook into global.ini ({saphana} needs to be stopped for doing that offline)
- Check integration of the hook during start-up

Use the hook from the SAPHanaSR package (available since version 0.153). Optionally copy it to your preferred
directory like /hana/share/myHooks. The hook must be available on all SAP HANA cluster nodes.

----
////

.Stop {hana}
===================================
Stop {SAPHANA} either with _HDB_ or using _sapcontrol_.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]

provider = SAPHanaSR
path = /usr/share/SAPHanaSR

[trace]
ha_dr_saphanasr = info
----
===================================

=== Configuring System Replication Operation Mode

When your system is connected as an {sapHanaSR} target you can find an entry in the _global.ini_
which defines the operation mode. Up to now there are the following modes available.

* _delta_datashipping_
* _logreplay_
* _logreplay_readaccess_

Until a takeover and re-registration in the opposite direction, the entry for the operation mode is missing on
your primary site. The first operation mode which was available was _delta_datashipping_. Today the preferred modes for HA are
_logreplay_ or _logreplay_readaccess_. Using the operation mode _logreplay_ makes your secondary site in the {saphana}
system replication a hot standby system.
For more details regarding all operation modes check the available SAP documentation such as
"How To Perform System Replication for SAP HANA ".

.Checking the Operation Mode
===================================
Check both _global.ini_ files and add the operation mode if needed.

section:: [ system_replication ]
entry:: operation_mode = logreplay

Path for the _global.ini_: /hana/shared/<SID>/global/hdb/custom/config/
----
[system_replication]
operation_mode = logreplay
----
===================================

=== Allowing {refsidadm} to access the Cluster

The current version of the SAPHanaSR python hook uses the command `sudo` to allow
the {refsidadm} user to access the cluster attributes. In Linux you can use `visudo`
to start the vi editor for the _/etc/sudoers_ configuration file.

The user {refsidadm} must be able to set the cluster attributes hana_{refsidLC}_site_srHook_*.
The {SAPHANA} system replication hook needs password free access. The following
example limits the sudo access to exactly setting the needed attribute.

Replace the {refsidLC} by the *lowercase* SAP system ID (like `{sapssid}`).

.Entry in sudo permissions /etc/sudoers file
===================================
Basic sudoers entry to allow <sidadm> to use the srHook.

// command to be allowed used in the hook:
// "sudo /usr/sbin/crm_attribute -n hana_%s_site_srHook_%s -v %s -t crm_config -s SAPHanaSR"

----
# SAPHanaSR-ScaleUp entries for writing srHook cluster attribute
{refsidadm} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: /usr/sbin/crm_attribute -n hana_{refsidLC}_site_srHook_*
----

More specific sudoers entries to meet a high security level. All Cmnd_Alias entries must be each defined as a single line entry.
In the following example the lines might include a line-break forced by document formatting. In our example we would have
four separate lines with Cmnd_Alias entries, one line for the {refsidadm} user and one or more lines for comments.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]

This chapter describes the configuration of the cluster software SUSE
Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension, which is part of the SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications, and {hana} Database
Integration.

// DONE PRIO1: Do we need to move that *before* we set-up the srHook?

.Actions
. Basic Cluster Configuration.

. Configure Cluster Properties and Resources.


=== Basic Cluster Configuration

The first step is to set up the basic cluster framework. For
convenience, use YaST2 or the {slehainit} script. It is strongly
recommended to add a second corosync ring, change to UCAST communication
and adjust the timeout values to your environment.

==== Set up Watchdog for "Storage-based Fencing"

// TODO PRIO2: Should we add some more information here?

If you use the SBD fencing mechanism (disk-less or disk-based), you must also
configure a watchdog. The watchdog is needed to reset a node if the system
could not longer access the SBD (disk-less or disk-based).
It is mandatory that to configure the Linux system to load a
watchdog driver. It is strongly recommended to use a watchdog with hardware #
assistance (as is available on most modern systems), such as hpwdt, iTCO_wdt,
or others. As a fall-back, you can use the softdog module.

.Set up for Watchdog
====
IMPORTANT: Access to the Watchdog Timer:
No other software must access the watchdog timer; it can only be
accessed by one process at any time. Some hardware vendors ship
systems management software that use the watchdog for system resets
(for example HP ASR daemon). Such software must be disabled if the watchdog
is to be used by SBD.

Determine the right watchdog module. Alternatively, you can find a list of
installed drivers with your kernel version.

----
ls -l /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/watchdog
----

Check if any watchdog module is already loaded.

----
lsmod | egrep "(wd|dog|i6|iT|ibm)"
----

If you get a result, the system has already a loaded watchdog. If the watchdog
does not match your watchdog device, you need to unload the module.

To safely unload the module, check first if an application is using the watchdog
device.

----
lsof /dev/watchdog
rmmod <wrong_module>
----

Enable your watchdog module and make it persistent. For the example below,
_softdog_ has been used which has some restrictions and should not be used as
first option.

----
echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
----

Check if the watchdog module is loaded correctly.

----
lsmod | grep dog
ls -l /dev/watchdog
----

Testing the watchdog can be done with a simple action. Ensure to switch of your {sapHana}
first because watchdog will force an unclean reset / shutdown of your system.

In case of a hardware watchdog a desired action is predefined after the timeout of the watchdog has
reached. If your watchdog module is loaded and not controlled by any other application, do the following:

IMPORTANT: Triggering the watchdog without continuously updating the watchdog
resets/switches off the system. This is the intended mechanism. The following
commands will force your system to be reset/switched off.

----
touch /dev/watchdog
----

In case the softdog module is used the following action can be performed:

----
echo 1> /dev/watchdog
----

After your test was successful you must implement the watchdog on all cluster
members.

====

==== Initial Cluster Setup Using `{slehainit}`

For more information, see _Automatic Cluster Setup_, {uarr}SUSE Linux
Enterprise High Availability Extension.

// DONE PRIO1: Use the -u flag to already produce a valid unicast configuration at the first cluster configuration step

Create an initial setup, using `{slehainit}` command and follow the
dialogs. This has only to be done on the first cluster node.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> {slehainit} -u -s <sbddevice>
----

// TODO PRIO1: for disk less SBD: {slehainit} -u -S
//
// TODO PRIO1: for more than one corosync ring
//      -u --unicast
//      -S --enable-sbd
//         --multi-heartbeats

This command configures the basic cluster framework including:

* SSH keys
* csync2 to transfer configuration files
* SBD (at least one device)
* corosync (at least one ring)
* HAWK Web interface

IMPORTANT: As requested by `{slehainit}`, change the password of the user hacluster.

==== Adapting the Corosync and SBD Configuration

It is recommended to add a second corosync ring. If you did not start {slehainit}
with the _-u_ option, you need to change corosync to use UCAST communication.
To change to UCAST stop the already running cluster by using `{clusterstop}`.
After the setup of the corosync configuration and the SBD parameters, start the cluster again.

===== Corosync Configuration

// TODO PRIO1: Remove this section and/or tell the reader to skip if the cluster was already set up with unicast

Check the following blocks in the file _/etc/corosync/corosync.conf_.
See also the example at the end of this document.

===== Adapting SBD Config

// TODO PRIO2: Should we add some information about SBD timing tunables?

You can skip this section if you do not have any SBD devices, but be
sure to implement another supported fencing mechanism.

See man pages sbd.8 and stonith_sbd.7 for details.

.SBD Options
[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|-W a|
Use watchdog. It is mandatory to use a watchdog. SBD does not work
reliable without watchdog. Refer to the {slsa} manual and SUSE
TIDs 7016880 for setting up a watchdog.

This is equivalent to `SBD_WATCHDOG="yes"`

|-S 1 a|
Start mode. If set to one, sbd will only start if the node was
previously shut down cleanly or if the slot is empty.

This is equivalent to `SBD_STARTMODE="clean"`

|-P a|
Check Pacemaker quorum and node health.

This is equivalent to `SBD_PACEMAKER="yes"`

|=======================================================================

In the following, replace {sapsbd1} and {sapsbd2} by your real sbd
device names.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# /etc/sysconfig/sbd
SBD_DEVICE="{sapsbd1};{sapsbd2}"

SBD_PACEMAKER="yes"
SBD_STARTMODE="clean"
SBD_OPTS=""
----

// TODO PRIO2: Add reference to product doc (theamatic calculation of timeouts)

===== Verifying the SBD Device

You can skip this section if you do not have any SBD devices, but make
sure to implement a supported fencing mechanism.

It is a good practice to check if the SBD device can be accessed from
both nodes and does contain valid records. Check this for all devices
configured in _/etc/sysconfig/sbd_.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----

----

// TODO Prio3: Check if we need to explain the timeout parameters of the sbd device (watchdog, allocate, loop, msgwait)

The timeout values in our sample are only start values, which need to be
tuned to your environment.

To check the current SBD entries for the various cluster nodes, you can
use `sbd list`. If all entries are `clear`, no fencing task is marked in
the SBD device.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # sbd -d {sapsbd1} list
0     {sapnode1}      clear
----

For more information on SBD configuration parameters, read the
section _Storage-based Fencing_, {uarr}SUSE Linux Enterprise High
Availability Extension and TIDs 7016880 and 7008216.

Now it is time to restart the cluster at the first node again
(`{clusterstart}`).

==== Cluster Configuration on the Second Node

The second node of the two nodes cluster could be integrated by starting
the command `{slehajoin}`. This command asks for the IP address or
name of the first cluster node. Than all needed configuration files are
copied over. As a result the cluster is started on both nodes.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# {slehajoin} -c {refHost1}
----

==== Checking the Cluster for the First Time

Now it is time to check and optionally start the cluster for the first
time on both nodes.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # {clusterstatus}
{sapnode1}:~ # {sbdstatus}
{sapnode2}:~ # {clusterstatus}
{sapnode1}:~ # {clusterstart}

{sapnode2}:~ # {clusterstart}
----

Check the cluster status with crm_mon. We use the option "-r" to also
see resources, which are configured but stopped.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm_mon -r
----

The command will show the "empty" cluster and will print something like
the following screen output. The most interesting information for now is
that there are two nodes in the status "online" and the message
"partition with quorum".

=== Configuring Cluster Properties and Resources

This section describes how to configure constraints, resources,
bootstrap and STONITH using the `crm configure` shell command as described
in section _Configuring and Managing Cluster Resources (Command Line)_ of the
{uarr}SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension documentation.

Use the command `crm` to add the objects to CRM. Copy the following
examples to a local file, edit the file and then load the configuration
to the CIB:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # vi crm-fileXX
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-fileXX
----

==== Cluster Bootstrap and More

The first example defines the cluster bootstrap options, the resource
and operation defaults. The stonith-timeout should be greater than 1.2
times the SBD msgwait timeout.

// TODO PRIO2: LP asks if that still works

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # vi crm-bs.txt
# enter the following to crm-bs.txt
property $id="cib-bootstrap-options" \
              stonith-enabled="true" \
              stonith-action="reboot" \
              stonith-timeout="150s"
rsc_defaults $id="rsc-options" \
              resource-stickiness="1000" \
              migration-threshold="5000"
op_defaults $id="op-options" \
                 timeout="600"
----

Now we add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-bs.txt
----

==== STONITH device

Skip this section if you are using disk-less SBD.

The next configuration part defines an SBD disk STONITH resource.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-sbd.txt
# enter the following to crm-sbd.txt
primitive stonith-sbd stonith:external/sbd \
    params pcmk_delay_max="15"
----

Again we add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-sbd.txt
----

For fencing with IPMI/ILO see section <<Using IPMI as fencing mechanism>>.

==== Using IPMI as fencing mechanism

For details about IPMI/ILO fencing see our cluster product documentation ({haAdminGuide12}).
An example for an IPMI STONITH resource can be found in section <<Example for the IPMI STONITH Method>>
of this document.

To use IPMI the remote management boards must be compatible with the
IPMI standard.

For the IPMI based fencing you need to configure a primitive per cluster
node. Each resource is responsible to fence exactly one cluster node.
You need to adapt the IP addresses and login user / password of the
remote management boards to the STONITH resource agent. We recommend to
create a special STONITH user instead of providing root access to the
management board. Location rules must guarantee that a host should never
run its own STONITH resource.

==== Using Other Fencing Mechanisms

We recommend to use SBD (best practice) or IPMI (second choice) as
STONITH mechanism. The SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability product
also supports additional fencing mechanism not covered here.

For further information about fencing, see SUSE Linux Enterprise High
Availability Guide.

==== SAPHanaTopology

Next we define the group of resources needed, before the HANA instances
can be started. Prepare the changes in a text file, for example
_crm-saphanatop.txt_, and load it with the command:

`crm configure load update crm-saphanatop.txt`

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-saphanatop.txt
# enter the following to crm-saphanatop.txt
primitive rsc_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} ocf:suse:SAPHanaTopology \
        op monitor interval="10" timeout="600" \
        op start interval="0" timeout="600" \
        op stop interval="0" timeout="300" \
        params SID="{sapsid}" InstanceNumber="{sapino}"
clone cln_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} rsc_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} \
        meta clone-node-max="1" interleave="true"
----

Additional information about all parameters can be found with the
command:

`man ocf_suse_SAPHanaTopology`

Again we add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-saphanatop.txt
----

The most important parameters here are SID and InstanceNumber, which are
in the SAP context quite self explaining. Beside these parameters, the
timeout values or the operations (start, monitor, stop) are typical
tuneables.

==== SAPHana

Next we define the group of resources needed, before the HANA instances
can be started. Edit the changes in a text file, for example
_crm-saphana.txt_, and load it with the command:

`crm configure load update crm-saphana.txt`

.Typical Resource Agent parameter settings for different scenarios
[width="99%",cols="52%,16%,16%,16%",options="header",]
|============================================================
|Parameter |Performance Optimized |Cost Optimized |Multi-Tier
|PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER |true |false |false / true
|AUTOMATED_REGISTER |false / true |false / true |false
|DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT |7200 |7200 |7200
|============================================================

// TODO PRIO1: Check if all parameters in special DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT
// are explained well

.Description of important Resource Agent parameters
[width="100%",cols="42%,58%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER |Defines whether RA should prefer to takeover to
the secondary instance instead of restarting the failed primary locally.

|AUTOMATED_REGISTER a|
Defines whether a former primary should be automatically registered to
be secondary of the new primary. With this parameter you can adapt the
level of system replication automation.

If set to `false`, the former primary must be manually registered. The
cluster will not start this SAP HANA RDBMS until it is registered to avoid
double primary up situations.

|DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT |Time difference needed between two primary
time stamps if a dual-primary situation occurs. If the time difference
is less than the time gap, than the cluster hold one or both instances
in a "WAITING" status. This is to give an administrator the chance to react on a
fail-over. If the complete node of the former primary crashed, the former
primary will be registered after the time difference is passed. If
"only" the SAP HANA RDBMS has crashed, then the former primary will be
registered immediately. After this registration to the new primary all
data will be overwritten by the system replication.
|=======================================================================

Additional information about all parameters could be found with the
command:

`man ocf_suse_SAPHana`

We add the configuration to the cluster.

{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-saphana.txt
----

The most important parameters here are again SID and InstanceNumber.
Beside these parameters the timeout values for the operations (start,
promote, monitors, stop) are typical tuneables.

==== The virtual IP address for The Primary Site

The last resource to be added to the cluster is covering the virtual IP
address.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-vip.txt
# enter the following to crm-vip.txt

primitive rsc_ip_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \
        op monitor interval="10s" timeout="20s" \
        params ip="{sapip1srv1}"
----

We load the file to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-vip.txt
----

In most installations, only the parameter ip needs to be set to the
virtual IP address to be presented to the client systems.

==== Constraints

Two constraints are organizing the correct placement of the virtual IP
address for the client database access and the start order between the
two resource agents SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-cs.txt
# enter the following to crm-cs.txt

colocation col_saphana_ip_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} 2000: rsc_ip_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}:Started \
    msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}:Master
order ord_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} Optional: cln_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} \
    msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}
----

We load the file to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-cs.txt
----

==== Active/Active Read-Enabled Scenario

This step is optional. If you have an active/active {saphana} system
replication with a read-enabled secondary, it is possible to integrate the
needed second virtual IP address into the cluster. This is been done by adding
a second virtual IP address resource and a location constraint binding the
address to the secondary site.

The lists of tests will be improved in the next update of this document.

As with any cluster testing is crucial. Make sure that all test
cases derived from customer expectations are implemented and passed
fully. Otherwise the project is likely to fail in production.

The test prerequisite, if not described differently, is always that both
nodes are booted, normal members of the cluster and the HANA RDBMS is
running. The system replication is in sync (SOK).

=== Test Cases for Semi Automation

In the following test descriptions we assume
`PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER="true"` and `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false".`

secondary (on node 2) as SFAIL.
.  If SBD fencing is used, then the manual recovery procedure will be
used to clear the fencing flag and restart pacemaker on the node.
.  When the fenced node (node 2) rejoins the cluster the former primary became a secondary.
. Because AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true" the cluster does restart
the failed HANA database and register it against the new primary.
.  The cluster detects that the system replication is in sync again
and marks it as ok (SOK).

== Administration

=== Do's and Don'ts

In your project, you should:

* Define STONITH before adding other resources to the cluster
* Do intensive testing.
* Tune the timeouts of operations of SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology.
* Start with PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER=”true”, AUTOMATED_REGISTER=”false” and
DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT=”7200”.

In your project, avoid:

* Rapidly changing/changing back cluster configuration, such as: Setting
nodes to standby and online again or stopping/starting the master/slave
resource.
* Creating a cluster without proper time synchronization or unstable
name resolutions for hosts, users and groups
* Adding location rules for the clone, master/slave or IP resource. Only
location rules mentioned in this setup guide are allowed.
* As "migrating" or "moving" resources in crm-shell, HAWK or other tools
would add client-prefer location rules this activities are completely
forbidden.

=== Monitoring and Tools

You can use the High Availability Web Console (HAWK), {hana} Studio and
different command line tools for cluster status requests.

==== HAWK – Cluster Status and more

You can use an Internet browser to check the cluster status.

// DONE PRIO1: We need a SLE12 HAWK screenshot here

.Cluster Status in HAWK
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUp-HAWK-Status-SLE12.png[scaledwidth=100%]

If you set up the cluster using {slehainit} and you have installed all
packages as described above, your system will provide a very useful Web
interface. You can use this graphical Web interface to get an overview
of the complete cluster status, perform administrative tasks or configure resources and cluster bootstrap parameters. Read our product
manuals for a complete documentation of this powerful user interface.

==== {hana} Studio

Database-specific administration and checks can be done with {hana}
studio.

// TODO PRIO1: We need a HANA Cockpit screen-shot here

.{hana} Studio – Landscape
image::hana_studio_landscape.png[scaledwidth=100%]

==== Cluster Command Line Tools

A simple overview can be obtained by calling `crm_mon`. Using option
`-r` shows also stopped but already configured resources. Option `-1`
tells `crm_mon` to output the status once instead of periodically.

----

See the manual page crm_mon(8) for details.

==== SAPHanaSR Command Line Tools
To show some SAPHana or SAPHanaTopology resource agent internal
values, you can call the program `SAPHanaSR-showAttr`. The internal
values, the storage location and their parameter names may change in the next
versions. The command `SAPHanaSR-showAttr` will always fetch the values
from the correct storage location.

Do not use cluster commands like `crm_attribute` to fetch the values
directly from the cluster. If you use such commands, your methods will be
broken when you need to move an attribute to a different storage place
or even out of the cluster. At first _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ is a test
program only and should not be used for automated system monitoring.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
 {sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-showAttr
 Host \ Attr clone_state remoteHost roles       ... site    srmode sync_state ...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 {sapnode2}      DEMOTED     {sapnode1}     4:S:master1:... {sapsite2}      sync  SOK        ...
----

`SAPHanaSR-showAttr` also supports other output formats such as *script*. The script
format is intended to allow running filters. The SAPHanaSR package beginning with
version 0.153 also provides a filter engine `SAPHanaSR-filter`. In combination of
`SAPHanaSR-showAttr` with output format script and `SAPHanaSR-filter` you can define
effective queries:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-showAttr --format=script | \
   SAPHanaSR-filter --search='remote'
Mon Nov 11 20:55:45 2019; Hosts/{sapnode1}/remoteHost={sapnode2}
Mon Nov 11 20:55:45 2019; Hosts/{sapnode2}/remoteHost={sapnode1}
----

`SAPHanaSR-replay-archive` can help to analyze the SAPHanaSR attribute values from
`hb_report` (`crm_report`) archives. This allows post mortem analyzes.

In our example, the administrator killed the primary {hana} instance using the command
`HDB kill-9`. This happened around 9:10 pm.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # hb_report -f 19:00
INFO: {sapnode1}# The report is saved in ./hb_report-1-11-11-2019.tar.bz2

INFO: {sapnode1}# Thank you for taking time to create this report.
{sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-replay-archive --format=script \
    ./hb_report-1-11-11-2019.tar.bz2 | \
    SAPHanaSR-filter --search='roles' --filterDouble

Mon Nov 11 20:38:01 2019; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=4:S:master1:master:worker:master
Mon Nov 11 21:11:37 2019; Hosts/{sapnode1}/roles=1:P:master1::worker:
Mon Nov 11 21:12:43 2019; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=4:P:master1:master:worker:master
----

In the above example the attributes indicate that at the beginning {sapnode1}
was running primary (4:P) and {sapnode2} was running secondary (4:S).

At 21:11 (CET) suddenly the primary on {sapnode1} died - it was falling down to 1:P.

The cluster did jump-in and initiated a takeover. At 21:12 (CET) the former secondary
was detected as new running master (changing from 4:S to 4:P).


==== {hana} LandscapeHostConfiguration

To check the status of an SAPHana database and to find out if the
cluster should react, you can use the script *landscapeHostConfiguration*
to be called as Linux user _<sid>adm_.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----

{sapnode1}:~> HDBSettings.sh landscapeHostConfiguration.py
| Host   | Host   | ... NameServer   | NameServer  | IndexServer | IndexServer |
|        | Active | ... Config Role  | Actual Role | Config Role | Actual Role |
| ------ | ------ | ... ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| {sapnode1} | yes    | ... master 1     | master      | worker      | master      |

overall host status: ok
----

Following the SAP HA guideline, the SAPHana resource agent interprets
the return codes in the following way:

.Interpretation of Return Codes
[width="100%",cols="15%,85%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Return Code |Interpretation
|4 |{hana} database is up and OK. The cluster does interpret this as a
correctly running database.

|3 |{hana} database is up and in status info. The cluster does
interpret this as a correctly running database.

|2 |{hana} database is up and in status warning. The cluster does
interpret this as a correctly running database.

|1 |{hana} database is down. If the database should be up and is not
down by intention, this could trigger a takeover.

|0 |Internal Script Error – to be ignored.
|=======================================================================

=== Maintenance

To receive updates for the operating system or the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension,
it is recommended to register your systems to either a local SUSE Manager or SMT or remotely with SUSE Customer Center.

==== Updating the OS and Cluster

For an update of {sles4sap} packages including cluster software follow the
rolling update procedure defined in the product documentation
of {sle} {ha} Extension _Upgrading Your Cluster and Updating Software Packages_
{uarr} {ha} Administration Guide.

==== Updating {hana} - Seamless {hana} Maintenance

For updating SAP HANA database systems in system replication you need to
follow the defined SAP processes. This section describes the steps to be
done before and after the update procedure to get the system replication
automated again.

{SUSE} has optimized the {hana} maintenance process in the cluster.
The improved procedure only sets the master-slave-resource to maintenance and
keep the rest of the cluster (SAPHanaTopology clones and IPaddr2 vIP resource)
still active. Using the updated procedure allows a seamless {hana} maintenance
in the cluster as the virtual IP address can automatically follow the running
primary.

//TODO: PRIO2 HINT for new wizard?!?!?!

Prepare the cluster not to react on the maintenance work to be done on
the SAP HANA database systems. Set the master/slave resource to be
unmanaged and the cluster nodes in maintenance mode.


// DONE PRIO1: Check, if command 'cleanup' is still valid (see discussion with E&I)
//             'cleanup' replaced by 'refresh'

.Main {hana} Update procedure
==============================
Pre Update Task:: For the master-slave-resource set the maintenance mode:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource maintenance <master-slave-resource>
----
+
The <master-slave-resource> in the given guide is `msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}`.

Update:: Process the SAP Update for both SAP HANA database systems. This
procedure is described by SAP.

Post Update Task:: Expect the primary/secondary roles to be exchanged
after the maintenance. Therefore, tell the cluster to forget about these states and to
reprobe the updated SAP HANA database systems.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource refresh <master-slave-resource>
----
+
After the SAP HANA update is complete on both sites, tell the cluster
about the end of the maintenance process. This allows the cluster to
actively control and monitor the {sap} again.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource maintenance <master-slave-resource> off
----

==============================

==== Migrating an {HANA} Primary

In the following procedures we assume the primary to be running on node1
and the secondary on node2. The goal is to "exchange" the roles of the
nodes, so finally the primary should run on node2 and the secondary
should run on node1.

There are different methods to get the exchange of the roles done. The
following procedure shows how to tell the cluster to "accept" a role
change via native HANA commands.

// TODO PRIO1: Check for takeover with handshake

.Migrating an {HANA} primary using {sap} Toolset
==============================
Pre move:: Set the master-slave-resource to be maintenance. This could be done on any
cluster node.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource maintenance <master-slave-resource-name>
----

// TODO PRIO1: Check -sr_takeover with 'hands-chake'

Manual Takeover Process::
* Stop the primary SAP HANA database system. Enter the command in our
example on node1 as user _<sid>adm_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
HDB stop
----
+
* Start the takeover process on the secondary SAP HANA database system.
Enter the command in our example on node2 as user _<sid>adm_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
hdbnsutil -sr_takeover
----
+
* Register the former primary to become the new secondary. Enter the
command in our example on node1 as user _<sid>adm_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost={sapnode2} --remoteInstance={sapino} \
 --replicationMode=sync --name={sapsite1} \
 --operationMode=logreplay
----
+
* Start the new secondary SAP HANA database system. Enter the command in
our example on node1 as user _<sid>adm_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
HDB start
----

Post Migrate::
* Wait some time till SAPHanaSR-showAttr shows both SAP HANA database
systems to be up again (field roles must start with the digit 4). The new
secondary should have role "S" (for secondary).
+
* Tell the cluster to forget about the former master-slave roles and to
re-monitor the failed master. The command could be submitted on any
cluster node as user root.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource refresh master-slave-resource-name
----
+
* Set the master/slave resource to the status managed again. The command
could be submitted on any cluster node as user root.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource maintenance <master-slave-resource-name> off
----
==============================

Now we explain how to use the cluster to partially automate the
migration. For the described attribute query using _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ and
_SAPHanaSR-filter_ you need at least SAPHanaSR with package version 0.153.

.Moving an {HANA} primary using the Cluster Toolset
==============================
* Create a "move away" from this node rule by using the *force* option.
+
[subs="attributes,specialchars,quotes"]
----
crm resource move <master-slave-resource-name> *force*
----
+
Because of the "move away" (*force*) rule the cluster will *stop* the
current primary. After that, run a *promote* on the secondary site if the system
replication was in sync before. You should not migrate the primary if
the status of the system replication is not in sync (SFAIL).
+
IMPORTANT: Migration without the *force* option will cause a takeover without the
former primary to be stopped. Only the migration with *force* option is supported.
+
NOTE: The crm resource command *move* was previously named *migrate*. The *migrate*
command is still valid but already known as obsolete.

* Wait till the secondary has completely taken over to be the new primary role. You
  see this using the command line tool _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ and check for the
  attributes "roles" for the new primary. It must start with "*4:P*".
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]

Mon Nov 11 20:38:50 2019; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=*4:P*:master1:master:worker:master
----

* If you have set up `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`, you can skip this step. In
other cases you now need to register the old primary. Enter the command
in our example on node1 as user _<sid>adm_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost={sapnode2} --remoteInstance={sapino} \

+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource clear <master-slave-resource-name>
----
+
NOTE: The crm resource command *clear* was previously named *unmigrate*. The *unmigrate*
command is still valid but already known as obsolete.

* Wait till the new secondary has started. You
  see this using the command line tool _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ and check for the
  attributes "roles" for the new primary. It must start with "*4:S*".
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]

----

==============================

////
* Set the primary node to be standby.

`crm node standby {sapnode1}`

The cluster will stop the primary SAP HANA database and, if the system
replication was in sync, process the takeover on the secondary site.

Wait until the former secondary has completely taken over to be the new
primary.

If you have set up `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`, you can skip this step. In
other cases you now need to register the old primary. Enter the command
in our example on node1 as user _<sid>adm_.

// DONE PRIO1: HANA 2.0 command?!?!?!

`hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost={sapnode2} --remoteInstance={sapino} --replicationMode=sync --name={sapsite1} --operationMode=logreplay`

Set the standby node to be online again.

`crm node online {sapnode1}`
