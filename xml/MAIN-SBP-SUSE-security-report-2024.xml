  <title>Motivation</title>

  <para>SUSE Solution Security is committed to delivering best-in-class software security to
   customers and to the open source community. The primary objectives are to treat software security
   as an ongoing and continual process that never ends. This implies the following actions:</para>

  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>Promptly react to security incidents and deliver premium quality security updates.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Continuously improve the security-related functionality in SUSE products.</para>

   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Respect the open source software security principles of openness, transparency and
     traceability.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>

  <para>The SUSE Security Team addresses all aspects of software security on an ongoing basis. 
   Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it
   is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This
   persistent focus is what has given open source software, Linux and SUSE an excellent reputation
   for security. The SUSE Solution Security team is responsible for handling all SUSE product-related 
   security incidents. In this team, clear and well-defined roles are assigned to track new incidents 
   and coordinate needed updates. The team closely collaborates with all SUSE software engineer specialists.</para>

  <para>The objective of this report is to provide a summary of all security vulnerabilities which
   affected SUSE products in calendar year 2024. We will go into details on the high-impact
   vulnerabilities and elaborate on how we responded to these incidents. For a better understanding 
   of our classification mechanisms, we have described our rating system along with the equivalency 
   of each rating to the CVSS v3.1 scoring calculator. Our Solution Security team has begun CVSS 4.0 scoring, 
   and we will display both CVSS v3.1 and CVSS v4.0 on our CVE Web pages for your information and reference.</para>

  <title>Background</title>

  <para>A modern Linux operating system, such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for enterprise use or
   the openSUSE community distribution for home use, features a rich set of security programs and
   functions. Those range from access control, intrusion prevention and detection, flexible and
   trustworthy authentication mechanisms, encryption for files and network connections, file
   integrity checking utilities, to network analysis tools and monitoring/logging utilities for your
   system. To complement this, there are advanced tools that help you to securely configure and
   administer your system, and to securely download and install update packages. These utilities are
   standard in SUSE products. The update packages fix security bugs that have been found after your
   product has been released. The security features of your Linux system are waiting for you to
   explore them. SUSE encourages our customers to take advantage of them to further improve the
   level of privacy and security that is built into every system by default. </para>

  <para>Programs are usually written by humans, and humans make mistakes. As a result, all
   software may contain errors. Some of these errors appear as instabilities (the software or the
   entire system crashes), while others may have no apparent effect. However, certain
   software errors can introduce security risks. A local or remote attacker may feed
   specially drafted data to the software in order to exploit the programming error. In the
   case of a remotely exploitable bug, the data comes from an attached network device, such as a
   cable or DSL modem, or a wireless network interface card. As a result, the affected application may
   either crash, leading to a Denial of Service (DoS) attack, or execute code crafted by the
   attacker. In the latter case, control over the execution context is transferred from the intended
   logic to the attacker's instructions, allowing them to exploit the vulnerability. Depending on the functionality 
   of the software, the resulting security breach may pose a low or high risk to your data 
   and system, potentially giving an attacker the opportunity to delete, modify or even steal your 
   data, or exploit the system for their own purposes.</para>

  <para>The SUSE Solution Security team manages all security incidents related to SUSE products.
   Within the team, specific and clearly defined roles ensure the tracking of new
   incidents and the coordination of necessary updates. The team works with all SUSE software 
   engineering specialists.</para>

  <para>We use multiple sources to understand security incidents. These sources include the MITRE
   and NVD Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases, various security mailing lists (OSS
   Security, Linux distros, Bugtraq and Full Disclosure), direct reports, and other Linux
   vendors' databases. We are also part of various pre-notification mailing lists for software
   components, like Xen, Samba and X.ORG. Confidential pre-notifications about vulnerabilities will be
   treated according to established responsible disclosure procedures.</para>

<!-- <sect1 xml:id="sec-incident-rating-tracking">
  <title>Incident rating and tracking</title>

  <para>We rate the severity of incidents with two different systems, a simplified rating system and
   the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 scoring system. The CVSS is an open framework
   for communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. It is being
   developed by the US-based non-profit organization FIRST.org. Its main goal is to assign the right
   score to a vulnerability to help security administrators prioritize responses and resources to
   specific threats. CVSS v3.1 scoring consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal and
   Environmental. The Base group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability that are
   constant over time and across user environments. The Temporal group reflects the characteristics
   of a vulnerability that change over time. The Environmental group represents the characteristics
   of a vulnerability that are unique to a user's environment. The Base metrics produce a score
   ranging from 0 to 10, which can then be modified by scoring the Temporal and Environmental
   metrics. A CVSS score is also represented as a vector string, a compressed textual representation
   of the values used to derive the score. Today, SUSE uses the Base score methodology to evaluate
   vulnerabilities throughout the support lifecycle of our products. SUSE keeps the right to adjust
   the final score of the vulnerability as more details become known and available throughout the
   analysis. The most current CVSS resources can be found at <link
    xlink:href="https://www.first.org/cvss/"/> . The CVSS v3.1 calculator used by SUSE could be
   found at <link xlink:href="https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1"/>. The framework is
   measuring the severity of a given vulnerability, not the associated risk alone. The scoring of
   any vulnerability may vary with different analysts, hence the final score could be slightly
   different between vendors impacted by that vulnerability. For a more accurate assessment of the
   impact, vendors and application owners must always consider factors outside of CVSS, such as
   exposure or threat.</para>

  <para> The security incidents are tracked in our own workflow system. Technical details are
   tracked in the SUSE bug-tracking system, and the updated software package is built, processed
   and published by our internal <quote>Open Build System</quote>. Internal Service Level Agreements
   (SLAs) corresponding to the severity rating are monitored and reviewed regularly. Our packagers
   backport the required security fixes to our version of the software. To protect the stability of
   our customer setups, we only rarely do minor version upgrades. After receiving fixes for the
   affected software, the patches undergo a four-eyes review to cross-check their content. Several automated checks
   verify source and binary compatibility and the completeness of patch meta information. They also
   check whether patches can be installed without problems. Dedicated QA teams provide integration,
   bugfix, and regression testing for all updates before they are released to our customers. After
   the release of an update, automated processes publish the updates, update notices, and cross
   reference information on our CVE index pages and machine-readable OVAL and CVRF XML
   information.</para>

  <para>For a better understanding of our classification mechanisms, we have described
   our rating system along with the equivalency of each rating to the CVSS v3.1 scoring
   calculator:</para>

       users to gain privileges, allow authenticated remote users to execute arbitrary code, and finally 
       allow unauthenticated remote users to view resources that should otherwise be protected by 
       authentication and to cause a denial of service without user interaction.</entry>

       evaluation of the flaw, or affect unlikely configurations. Local, persistent (service needs

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-xz-liblzma5">
   <title>CVE-2024-3094 (supply chain attack against xz)</title>

   <bridgehead>Overview</bridgehead>
   <para>SUSE received notification of a supply chain attack against the <package>xz</package> compression tool 
    and <package>liblzma5</package> library. </para>

   <para>Security Researcher Andres Freund reported to Debian that the <package>xz</package> / <package>liblzma</package> 
    library had been backdoored. Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of <package>xz</package>, 
    starting with version 5.6.0. This backdoor was introduced in the upstream GitHub <package>xz</package> project with
    release 5.6.0 in February 2024. Through a series of complex obfuscations, the <package>liblzma</package> build process 
    extracts a pre-built object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific 
    functions in the <package>liblzma</package> code. This results in a modified liblzma library that, among other malicious 
    functionalities, added a backdoor to allow the attacker arbitrary code execution via <package>ssh</package>.</para>

   <bridgehead>Solution</bridgehead>
   <para>To maintain product integrity, SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE Leap are built in isolation from openSUSE 
    Tumbleweed. This prevents the automatic inclusion of Tumbleweed's code, functionalities, and characteristics. 
    Rigorous analysis has confirmed that the malicious file present in Tumbleweed is not incorporated into SUSE Linux 
    Enterprise or Leap. Moreover, SUSE has verified that SUSE Linux Enterprise BCI, SUSE Rancher, SUSE Edge, and SUSE 
    Multi-Linux Support (formerly SUSE Liberty Linux) remain unaffected. SUSE has not released <package>xz</package>
    versions 5.6.0 or 5.6.1 in any product offering other than openSUSE Tumbleweed. We will continue to monitor this 
    situation and issue updates as necessary.</para>

    <para> Following this incident, SUSE conducted internal and external brainstorming sessions to identify mitigations 
     against supply chain attacks. A summary of these discussions is available on our opensuse.org brainstorming page. 
     We have already begun implementing several of these ideas, recognizing that no single solution fully eliminates 
     such threats.</para>

   <title>CVE-2024-22030 (Man-in-the-middle (MITM) vulnerability exploitable in Rancher)</title>

   <bridgehead>Overview</bridgehead>
   <para>A newly discovered vulnerability within Rancher and Fleet, currently 
   deemed a medium to high severity CVE-2024-22030, can be exploited in narrow 
   circumstances through a man-in-the middle attack. An attacker would need to 
   have control of an expired domain or execute a DNS spoofing/hijacking attack 
   against the domain in order to exploit this vulnerability. The targeted domain 
   is the one used as the Rancher URL. SUSE is not aware of any commercial 
   exploitation of the described vulnerability, which has a high complexity bar 
   for exploitation. Below, please find the advised remediation for all Rancher 
   customers and users. </para>

   <title>CVE-2023-21400, CVE-2023-3609, CVE-2022-32250, CVE-2022-29582, CVE-2022-27666,

   memory corruption vulnerabilities exploitable through the SLUBStick technique)</title>

   <bridgehead>Overview</bridgehead>

   <para>Researchers from the Graz University of Technology have recently 
   released a paper in which they present how they were able to take heap memory 
   corruption vulnerabilities and memory allocation flaws in the Linux kernel, 
   such as out-of-bounds writes, use-after-frees and double-frees, and, together 
   with a sophisticated multiple-stage technique developed by them, use such 
   vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary read and write capabilities in a vulnerable 
   system. Threat actors can therefore use such a technique to turn what would 
   otherwise be limited read and write capabilities with a small impact into attacks 
   that can gravely compromise a system.</para>

   <para>The SLUBStick technique achieves such an objective by manipulating the 
   Linux kernel's SLUB memory allocator in specific ways. This allows an attacker 
   to perform reliable cross-cache attacks that deliver better results than other 
   known techniques, which would usually only lead to system crashes rather than 
   allow for code execution. This reliability improvement comes from the timing 
   side-channel approach proposed by the researchers. A memory corruption 
   vulnerability can then be transformed into a page table entry rewrite, which 
   allows an attacker to map any physical memory in the system into their 
   address space, giving them the arbitrary read and write capabilities that can 
   lead to other more serious consequences.</para>

   <para>To successfully exploit a vulnerability through the use of the SLUBStick 
   technique, an attacker needs local access to the target machine, as well as 
   privileges that would allow them to execute code in this same machine. Finally, 
   the Linux kernel in such a machine must contain an unpatched heap memory corruption 
   vulnerability that could be exploited.</para>
   
   <bridgehead>Solution</bridgehead>

  <para>SUSE products (both under general and under LTSS support) that could 
  potentially be attacked through the use of the SLUBStick technique have already 
  been fixed for the related vulnerabilities and, therefore, no longer are at 
  risk when it comes to the example cases presented in the research.</para>

  <para>SUSE is also taking continuous action to fix memory corruption 
  vulnerabilities affecting the Linux kernel as they are reported. In this way, 
  SUSE products stay hardened and protected against any additional vulnerabilities 
  that might be exploitable through the SLUBStick technique.</para>

  <para>Keeping systems updated with the latest kernel patches should provide 
  sufficient protection against this issue.</para>
  
  <para>SLUBStick is not a security vulnerability in itself, it is a technique 
  that makes exploitation of other vulnerabilities easier. Hence, SLUBStick is not 
  assigned a CVE number and mitigation happens through fixing other vulnerabilities 
  that could be potentially exploited by this technique.</para>

  <title>What’s new in 2024: An increased amount of reported kernel security vulnerabilities </title>
  
  <para>In 2024, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) experienced a significant surge in reported security 
   vulnerabilities. This increase is largely attributed to the Linux kernel team, which, via its own CVE Numbering 
   Authority (CNA), has recently begun issuing CVEs for a broader range of kernel issues. Their inclusive approach, 
   covering diverse kernel use-cases from embedded systems to enterprise deployments, results in the issuance of 
   many CVEs that do not impact SUSE Linux product usage. Nonetheless, SUSE engineers addressed over 4,000 unique 
   CVEs affecting various kernel versions in 2024.</para>
  
  <para>A significant number of allocated CVEs do not pose an exploitable risk within SUSE Linux kernels. 
  In alignment with industry standards, SUSE will not address CVEs falling under the following categories:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>Code SUSE does not build into its kernels</para>
    <para>CVEs targeting code that is not enabled in SUSE kernels through CONFIG options. That includes drivers 
     which are not enabled but also debugging code like VM_BUG_ON etc.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Testing infrastructure</para>
    <para>Fixes for tools or test scenarios that are not meant to be run on production systems.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>WARN_ON fixes</para>
    <para>SUSE default and recommended configurations, which only trigger warnings due to disabled 
     <command>panic_on_warn</command>.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Small GFP_KERNEL allocation failures triggering <emphasis role="strong">NULL ptr</emphasis></para>
    <para>Fixes adding allocation failure checks to prevent from NULL ptr crashes for very small allocations. 
     If the allocation request is GFP_KERNEL and the allocation size is small (&lt;= PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER),
     then an allocation failure is practically impossible. This means that those fixes are never tested and, 
     therefore, are risky to introduce, potentially leading to unwanted side effects that would be harder to 
     notice. The benefit of the fix is therefore much smaller than the risk fixing it might cause.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para><package>debugfs</package> only fixes</para>
    <para><package>debugfs</package>, a kernel debugging interface, lacks the rigorous API/ABI scrutiny applied to 
     other kernel functionalities. Consequently, enabling <package>debugfs</package> is discouraged, especially on 
     production systems. If required, access should be strictly limited to privileged users. On SUSE systems, 
     <package>debugfs</package> access is restricted to root only.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Boot time crashes</para>
    <para>Fixes for boot time crashes, either because of an unexpected HW configuration (LPAR configurations, 
     device tree misconfiguration, BIOS/FW bugs) or because of kernel command line misconfiguration.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Memory leaks that cannot be directly triggered from the user space</para>
    <para>CVEs assigned for memory leaks, which are either impractical to trigger (for example, clean up not done 
     on module unloading) or on a failure path which is not controllable by an attacker.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Hardware-specific failure trigger</para>
    <para>Kernel crashes triggered by a HW failure are not considered a security threat unless they can be directly 
     triggered by a user.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>Note that some failure modes are generally not recoverable and the only effective protection is 
   physical inaccessibility (for example, storage connectivity) but there are use cases which are primarily focused 
   on the third-party HW controlled by potential attacker (for example, USB stick kiosk). The latter is considered a 
   real security attack vector, while the former is not.</para>
  
  <para>SUSE will also decide on a case-by-case basis about:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>Issues triggered solely by system root/CAP_SYSADMIN</para>
    <para>If a crash/use-after-free (UAF) or similar issue is only triggered by a privileged user, those fixes are not 
     considered security relevant because such a user can already compromise the security of the system. 
     This would include interfaces like fault injection (for example, HW poisoning), sysctl/sysfs/proc configurations

 <title>Proactive review of code</title>
 
 <para>Our skilled team of security engineers regularly reviews the code we ship. 
  We harden our products and conduct security audits on selected packages. Packages and products 
  are continually reviewed to ensure we protect our customers' systems with the latest state-of-the-art
  technology. To this end, we have introduced an automation setup that notifies our team of 
  potentially dangerous changes in existing or new packages (for example, important permission changes) 
  and triggers an audit if necessary.</para>
 
 <para>Over the last year, our proactive Security team has found and assigned CVE IDs to a number

   <title>Adoption of SELinux in openSUSE Tumbleweed, SUSE Linux Micro 6.x and SUSE Linux Enterprise 16</title>
   
   <para>We recently announced that for openSUSE Tumbleweed, the default mandatory access control (MAC) system 
    selected by the installer will be switched from AppArmor to SELinux in enforcing mode. Additionally, the 
    openSUSE Tumbleweed minimal VM is shipped with SELinux in enforcing mode. </para>
   
   <para>Users installing openSUSE Tumbleweed via the ISO image will see SELinux in enforcing mode as a default option 
    in the installer. If the user prefers to use AppArmor instead of SELinux, they can change the selection to 
    AppArmor manually in the installer.</para>
   
   <para>AppArmor continues to be excellently maintained by Christian Boltz (@cboltz) as before.</para>
   
   <para>Existing installations using AppArmor will <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> be migrated. 
    In case the user wishes to migrate manually to SELinux, a guide is provided on the openSUSE Wiki in the Reference 
    links below.</para>
   
   <para>Following this model in our enterprise-grade solutions, we have switched to SELinux in our
