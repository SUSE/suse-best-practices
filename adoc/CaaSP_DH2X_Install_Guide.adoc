== Appendix


=== Installing a Secure Private Docker Registry

To meet the Data Hub requirements you also need a Docker Registry.
The Portus project provides an easy way to build and manage an own Docker Registry.
For more information, see the project homepage at http://port.us.org/.

To set up Portus in a dedicated virtual machine, do:

. Create a suitable a virtual machine:
+
----
# sudo virt-install --name portus-dr --ram 8192 \
  --disk path=/var/lib/libvirt/VMS/portus-dr.qcow2,size=40 --vcpus 4 \
  --os-type linux --os-variant generic --network bridge=common --graphics none \
  --console pty,target_type=serial \
  --location '/var/lib/libvirt/isos/SLE-12-SP4-Server-DVD-x86_64-GM-DVD1.iso' \
  --extra-args 'console=ttyS0,115200n8 serial ifcfg=eth0=10.10.10.11/24,10.10.10.1,10.10.10.11,suse-sap.net hostname=portus-dr domain=suse-sap.net Textmode=1'
----

. In this example, the Portus server will be connected to a local bridge providing common services (DNS, SMT, and Docker Registry) for the SAP Data Hub 2 stack.
Our Portus deployment is container-based and orchestrated locally with `docker-compose`.
Portus `docker-compose` deployment requires an up-to-date release of `docker-compose`.
To install `docker-compose`, use:
+
----
# sudo curl -L "https://github.com/docker/compose/releases/download/1.24.1/docker-compose-$(uname -s)-$(uname -m)" -o /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
# sudo chmod +x /usr/local/bin/docker-compose
# sudo ln -s /usr/local/bin/docker-compose /usr/bin/docker-compose
----

. Clone the Portus Git repository:
+
----
# git clone https://github.com/SUSE/Portus.git /tmp/Portus-DR
# mv /tmp/Portus-DR/examples/compose ./portus
# cd portus
----

. Adapt the configuration in the `.env`.
As an example, a valid configuration may look like this:
+
----
# cat .env

MACHINE_FQDN=portus-dr.suse-sap.net
SECRET_KEY_BASE=b494a25faa8d22e430e843e220e424e10ac84d2ce0e64231f5b636d21251
eb6d267adb042ad5884cbff0f3891bcf911bdf8abb3ce719849ccda9a4889249e5c2
PORTUS_PASSWORD=XXXXXXXX
DATABASE_PASSWORD=YYYYYYYY
----

. In the `nginx/nginx.conf` file, adapt the following section:
+
----
server {
    listen 443 ssl http2;
    server_name portus-dr.suse-sap.net;
    root /srv/Portus/public;
----

. Download the latest `docker-compose.yml` for Portus:
+
----
# rm docker-compose.*
# wget https://gist.githubusercontent.com/Patazerty/d05652294d5874eddf192c9b633751ee/raw/6bf4ac6ba14192a1fe5c337494ab213200dd076e/docker-compose.yml
----

. To secure your Docker Registry configuration, add TLS to your setup:
+
----
# echo "subjectAltName = DNS:portus-dr.suse-sap.net" > extfile.cnf

# openssl genrsa -out secrets/rootca.key 2048

# openssl req -x509 -new -nodes -key secrets/rootca.key -subj "/C=FR/ST=FR/O=SUSE" \
  -sha256 -days 1024 -out secrets/rootca.crt

# openssl genrsa -out secrets/portus.key 2048

# openssl req -new -key secrets/portus.key -out secrets/portus.csr \
  -subj "/C=FR/ST=FR/O=SUSE/CN

# openssl req -new -key secrets/portus.key -out secrets/portus.csr \
  -subj "/C=FR/ST=FR/O=SUSE/CN=portus-dr.suse-sap.net"

# openssl x509 -req -in secrets/portus.csr -CA secrets/rootca.crt \
  -extfile extfile.cnf -CAkey secrets/rootca.key -CAcreateserial \
  -out secrets/portus.crt -days 500 -sha256
----

. Make the servers aware of the new certificate:
+
----
# cp -p secrets/rootca.crt /etc/pki/trust/anchors/.net-ca.crt
# scp secrets/rootca.crt root@jumpbox.suse-sap.net:/etc/pki/trust/anchors/portus-dr.suse-sap.net-ca.crt
----

. Update the certificate on all servers that will need to interact with the Docker registry:
+
----
# sudo update-ca-certificates
# sudo systemctl restart docker
----

. Start your Portus setup with the following command:
+
----
# docker-compose up -d
----

. Log in to Portus and set up the registry as shown below:
+
image::portus-registry.png[title="Portus Registry",scaledwidth=80%]

. To install and configure a secure private registry using SUSE Linux Enterprise Server with the Container Module,
the necessary components are Docker, Docker Registry, and Portus.
Create SSL certificates as needed. Distribute the CA certificate to all your Kubernetes nodes.
Run the command:
+
----
# update-ca-certificates
# systemctl restart docker
----

. Create the namespaces on your registry that are needed for SAP Data Hub 2:
+
* com.sap.hana.container

* com.sap.datahub.linuxx86_64

* com.sap.datahub.linuxx86_64.gcc6

* consul

* elasticsearch

* fabric8

* google_containers

* grafana

* kibana

* prom

* vora

* kaniko-project

* com.sap.bds.docker


//TODO list of namespaces


=== SUSE Enterprise Storage

//SAP Data Hub 2 installation on premise requires SUSE Enterprise Storage 5 or higher.
//Follow the installation documentation to create SUSE Enterprise Storage.
//Create a storage pool on your SES for the use with SAP Data Hub 2.
//You can also leverage the S3 API to create buckets on SES that can be used from applications from within SAP Data Hub 2.


An SAP Data Hub 2 installation on premise requires SUSE Enterprise Storage 5 or higher.
If you plan to use SUSE Enterprise Storage not only for your Kubernetes dynamic storage class but also for your Kubernetes Control plan, virtualized or not, reserve enough resources to address `etcd` requirements regarding
link:https://github.com/etcd-io/etcd/blob/master/Documentation/op-guide/hardware.md[etcd Hardware].

The following steps show a minimalist, virtualized, test-oriented deployment of SUSE Enterprise Storage 5.5.

In the following example, we are going to build a 4 nodes (1 admin + 3 OSD) Ceph Cluster.

Before you start, be sure to:

* Collect your SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3 and SUSE Enterprise Storage 5 registration code from https://scc.suse.com. Alternatively, have an SMT/RMT properly set up and already mirroring these products.

** link:https://scc.suse.com[SCC]
** link:https://documentation.suse.com/sles-12/html/SLES-all/book-smt.html[SMT]

* Your DNS zone should already be set. In our example, where all Data Hub components are in the same DNS zone and subnet, it should look similar to the following:
+
image::dns.png[title="DNS Server",scaledwidth=80%]

* Also, to be as efficient as possible when using an interactive shell-scripted infrastructure deployment, we recommend using an advanced terminal client or multiplexer which allows addressing multiple shells at once.

. On the hypervisor, you should also be able to route or bridge (either a traditional bridge using `brctl` or a virtual bridge) your upcoming SUSE Enterprise Storage 5.5 network segment.
In our example, for simplicity, we are using the same bridge and network address as the SUSE CaaS Platform cluster, `--network bridge=caasp3`.

. In the following example, each node is powered by 16 GB of RAM, 4 VCPU, 40 GB for the root disk, 4 * 20GB OSDB disk.

. When the nodes are rebooted, log in and finish the network/host name and NTP configurations so that `hostname -f` returns the FQDN of the nodes and `ntpq -p` returns a stratum less than 16.

. Using `ssh-keygen` and then `ssh-copy-id`, send your SUSE Enterprise Storage administration node SSH public key to all other nodes.

. Verify that the drives you are going to allocate for SUSE Enterprise Storage OSDs are clean by wiping them.

. Install `salt-minion` on all nodes (including the administration node).

. On the administration node (in our example, `ses55-admin.suse-sap.net`), additionally install `salt-master` and `deepsea`.

. Restart `salt-minion` on all nodes and `salt-master` on the administration node.
