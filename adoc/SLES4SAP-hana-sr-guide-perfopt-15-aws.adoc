=== Introduction

{sles4sapreg} is optimized in various ways for {SAPreg} applications. This
guide provides detailed information about installing and customizing
{sles4sap} for {hana} system replication in the {usecase} scenario.

“{SAP} customers invest in {hana}” is the conclusion reached by a recent
market study carried out by Pierre Audoin Consultants (PAC). In Germany,
half of the companies expect {hana} to become the dominant
database platform in the {SAP} environment. Often the “{SAP}
Business Suite* powered by {hana}*” scenario is already being discussed
in concrete terms.

{SUSE} is accommodating this development by providing {sles4sap}
which is the recommended and supported operating system for {hana}. In close
collaboration with {SAP} and hardware partners, {SUSE} provides two
resource agents for customers to ensure the high availability of {hana} system
replications.

==== Abstract

This guide describes planning, setup, and basic testing of
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications based on
the high availability solution scenario
"SAP HANA Scale-Up System Replication Performance Optimized".

From the application perspective the following variants are covered:

- Plain system replication

- System replication with secondary site read-enabled

- Multi-tier (chained) system replication

- Multi-target system replication

- Multi-tenant database containers for all above

From the infrastructure perspective the following variants are covered:

- 2-node cluster with AWS specific fencing

==== Scale-up versus scale-out

The first set of scenarios includes the architecture and development of
_scale-up_ solutions.

.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster
image::hana_sr_in_cluster.svg[scaledwidth=70.0%]

For these scenarios {SUSE} developed the scale-up
resource agent package `{SAPHanaSR}`. System replication will help to
replicate the database data from one computer to another to compensate for database failures (single-box replication).

//.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster
//image::hana_sr_in_cluster.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]

The second set of scenarios includes the architecture and development of
_scale-out_ solutions (multi-box replication). For these scenarios {SUSE}
developed the scale-out resource agent package `{SAPHanaSR}-ScaleOut`.

.{hana} System Replication Scale-Out in the Cluster
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Cluster.svg[scaledwidth=70.0%]

With this mode of operation, internal {hana} high availability (HA)
mechanisms and the resource agent must work together or be coordinated
with each other. {hana} system replication automation for scale-out
is described in a separate document available on our documentation Web page
at {reslibrary}. The document for scale-out is named _"{docScaleOut}"_.

==== Scale-up scenarios and resource agents

{SUSE} has implemented the scale-up scenario with the `{SAPHanaRA}` resource
agent (RA), which performs the actual check of the {HANA} database
instances. This RA is configured as a multi-state resource. In the
scale-up scenario, the master assumes responsibility for the {hana}
databases running in primary mode. The slave is responsible for
instances that are operated in synchronous (secondary) status.

To make configuring the cluster as simple as possible, SUSE has also
developed the `{SAPHanaTopRA}` resource agent. This RA runs on all nodes
of a {sles4sap} cluster and gathers information about the
statuses and configurations of {hana} system replications. It is
designed as a normal (stateless) clone.

{hana} System replication for Scale-Up is supported in the following
scenarios or use cases:

* *Performance optimized* (_A => B_). This scenario and setup *is
described in this document.*
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-perfOpt.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
In the performance optimized scenario, an {hana} RDBMS site A is synchronizing
with an {HANA} RDBMS site B on a second node. As the HANA RDBMS on the second node
is configured to pre-load the tables, the takeover time is typically very
short.
+
One big advance of the performance optimized scenario of {hana} is the
possibility to allow read access on the secondary database site. To support
this *read enabled* scenario, a second virtual IP address is added to the cluster
and bound to the secondary role of the system replication.
* *Cost optimized* (_A => B, Q_). This scenario and setup is described
in another document available from the documentation Web page ({reslibrary}). The document for _cost optimized_ is named
_"{docCostOpt}"_.
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - cost optimized
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-costOpt2.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
In the cost optimized scenario the second node is also used for a
non-productive {hana} RDBMS system (like QAS or TST). Whenever a takeover
is needed, the non-productive system must be stopped first. As the
productive secondary system on this node must be limited in using system
resources, the table preload must be switched off. A possible
takeover needs longer than in the performance optimized use case.
+
In the cost optimized scenario the secondary needs to be running in a reduced
memory consumption configuration. This why _read enabled_ must not be used in this
scenario.
* *Multi Tier* (_A => B -> C_) and *Multi Target* (_B <= A => C_).
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized chain
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-Chain.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
A _multi-tier_ system replication has an additional target. In the past this third
side must have been connected to the secondary (chain topology). With current {saphana}
versions also _multiple target topology_ is allowed by {sap}.
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized multi target
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-MultiTarget.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
Multi-tier and multi-target systems are implemented as described in this document.
Only the first replication pair (A and B) is handled by the cluster itself.
The main difference to the plain performance optimized scenario is that the auto
registration must be switched off.

* *Multi-tenancy* or MDC.
+
Multi-tenancy is supported for all above scenarios and use cases. This
scenario is supported since {hana} SPS09. The setup and configuration
from a cluster point of view is the same for multi-tenancy and single
container. Thus you can use the above documents for both kinds of
scenarios.

// TODO PRIO1: Add new restrictions here (think about multi target, handshake, ...)

==== The concept of the performance optimized scenario

In case of failure of the primary {HANA} on node 1 (node or database
instance), the cluster first tries to start the takeover process. This
allows to use the already loaded data at the secondary site. Typically
the takeover is much faster than the local restart.

To achieve an automation of this resource handling process,
use the {hana} resource agents included in {SAPHanaSR}. System
replication of the productive database is automated with {SAPHanaRA} and
{SAPHanaTopRA}.

The cluster only allows a takeover to the secondary site if the {hana}
system replication was in sync until the point when the service of the primary
got lost. This ensures that the last commits processed on the primary site are
already available at the secondary site.

{sap} did improve the interfaces between {saphana} and external software such as
cluster frameworks. These improvements also include the implementation of {saphana}
call outs in case of special events such as status changes for services or system replication
channels. These call outs are also called HA/DR providers. This interface can be used by
implementing {saphana} hooks written in python. {suse} improved the SAPHanaSR package
to include such {saphana} hooks to optimize the cluster interface. Using the
{saphana} hook described in this document allows to inform the cluster immediately
if the {saphana} system replication breaks. In addition to the {saphana} hook status,
the cluster continues to poll the system replication status on regular base.

You can set up the level of automation by setting the parameter
`AUTOMATED_REGISTER`. If automated registration is activated, the cluster
will also automatically register a former failed primary to get the new
secondary.

IMPORTANT: The solution is not designed to manually 'migrate' the primary or
secondary instance using HAWK or any other cluster client commands. In the
_Administration_ section of this document we describe how to 'migrate' the primary to the secondary site
using {sap} and cluster commands.

==== Customers receive complete package

Using the SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology resource agents, customers
can integrate {hana} system replications in their
cluster. This has the advantage of enabling companies to use not only
their business-critical SAP systems but also their {hana} databases
without interruption while noticeably reducing needed budgets. SUSE
provides the extended solution together with best practices
documentation.

SAP and hardware partners who do not have their own {hana}
high availability solution will also benefit from this development from SUSE.

[[cha.hana-sr.scenario]]
== Supported scenarios and prerequisites

With the `SAPHanaSR` resource agent software package, we limit the
support to scale-up (single-box to single-box) system replication with
the following configurations and parameters:

* Two-node clusters.
* The cluster must include a valid STONITH method.

// begin AWS
* The AWS STONITH mechanism supported by SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 High Availability Extension is supported with SAPHanaSR.
* Each cluster node is in a different Availability Zone (AZ) within the same AWS Region.
* The Overlay IP address must be an IP outside the Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) CIDR.
// end AWS

* Technical users and groups, such as _<sid>adm_, are defined locally in the Linux system.
* Name resolution of the cluster nodes and the Overlay IP address must
be done locally on all cluster nodes.
* Time synchronization between the cluster nodes like NTP is required.
* Both {hana} instances (primary and secondary) have the same SAP Identifier (SID) and instance
number.
* If the cluster nodes are installed in different data centers or data center areas, 
the environment must match the requirements of the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension cluster product. 
Of particular concern are the network latency and recommended maximum distance between the nodes. 
Review the product documentation for SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension about those recommendations.
* Automated registration of a failed primary after takeover is available.
* SAP HANA Replication should be set to *SYNC* or *SYNCMEM* - *ASYNC* is not supported by the cluster.
* SAP HANA Replication mode can be either _logreplay_, _logreplay_readaccess_ or _delta_datashipping_
** As a good starting configuration for projects, we recommend to switch
off the automated registration of a failed primary. The setup
`AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"` is the default. In this case, you need to
register a failed primary after a takeover manually. Use SAP tools like
{saphana} cockpit or _hdbnsutil_.
** For optimal automation, we recommend `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`.
* Automated start of {hana} instances during system boot must be switched off.
* Multi-tenancy (MDC) databases are supported.
** Multi-tenancy databases could be used in combination with any other
setup (performance based, cost optimized and multi-tier).
** In MDC configurations the SAP HANA RDBMS is treated as a single
system including all database containers. Therefore, cluster takeover
decisions are based on the complete RDBMS status independent of the
status of individual database containers.
** For {hana} 1.0 you need version SPS10 rev3, SPS11 or newer if you want to stop
tenants during production and if you want the cluster to be able to take over.
Older {hana} versions are marking the system replication as failed if
you stop a tenant.
** Tests on multi-tenancy databases could force a different test procedure
if you are using strong separation of the tenants. As an example, killing the
complete {hana} instance using _HDB kill_ does not work, because the tenants are
running with different Linux user UIDs. {refsidadm} is not allowed to terminate the
processes of the other tenant users.

You need at least {SAPHanaSR} version {sapHanaSrMinVers} and in best {sles4sap} {prodnr}
{prodsp} or newer. {hana} 1.0 is supported since SPS09 (095) for all mentioned setups.
{hana} 2.0 is supported with all known SPS versions.

IMPORTANT: Without a valid STONITH method, the complete cluster is unsupported and will not work properly.

If you need to implement a different scenario, we strongly recommend to define a Proof of Concept (PoC) with SUSE. 
This PoC will focus on testing the existing solution in your scenario. 
Most of the above mentioned limitations are because careful testing is needed.

Besides {hana}, you need SAP Host Agent to be installed on your system.

[[cha.hana-sr.scope]]
== Scope of this document

This document describes how to set up the cluster to control {hana} in
System Replication Scenarios. The document focuses on the steps to
integrate an already installed and working {hana} with System
Replication.

The described example setup builds an {hana} HA cluster in two Availability Zones in one AWS Region. 
Availability Zone 1 is "A" and Availability Zone 2 is "B", installed on two SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications 15 SP1 systems.

NOTE: The preferred method to deploy SAP HANA scale-up clusters in AWS is to use the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/launchwizard/latest/userguide/launch-wizard-sap.html[AWS Launch Wizard for SAP]. 
However, if you are installing SAP HANA scale-up manually, refer to the link:https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sap/latest/sap-hana/welcome.html[AWS SAP HANA Guides] for detailed installation instructions, including recommended storage configuration and file systems.

=== AWS requirements for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server clusters

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server pacemaker clusters will run in an AWS region. 

An AWS region consists of multiple independent Availability Zones (AZs), which is one or more discrete data centers with redundant power, 
networking, and connectivity in an AWS Region. AZs give customers the ability to operate production applications and databases 
that are more highly available, fault tolerant, and scalable than would be possible from a single data center. 
All AZs in an AWS Region are interconnected with high-bandwidth, low-latency networking, over fully redundant, 
dedicated metro fiber providing high-throughput, low-latency networking between AZs. All traffic between AZs is encrypted. 
The network performance is sufficient to accomplish synchronous replication between AZs.

An AWS Virtual Private Network (VPC) spans all AZs within an AWS Region, thus the following is required:

-	Select two Availability Zones within a Region for the SAP HANA cluster implementation.
-	Identify one subnet in both AZs to host the two nodes of a SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension cluster.
-	Use one or more routing tables which are attached to the two subnets.
-	Optionally, host a Route53 private hosted naming zone to manage names in the VPC
-	All components of the cluster and AWS services should reside in the same Amazon account. The use of networking components such as a route
    table in another account (shared VPC setup) is not supported.
    If a multi account landscape is required, we advise you reach to your AWS representative
    to have a look at implementing a Transit Gateway for cross account/VPC access.

The virtual IP address for the SAP HANA will be an AWS Overlay IP address. This is an AWS specific routing table entry which will send network traffic to an instance,
no matter which AZ the instance is located in. The SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension cluster updates this VPC routing table entry as needed.

The Overlay IP addresses needs to be different from the VPC CIDR range.
All SAP system components within the VPC can reach an AWS EC2 instance through this Overlay IP address.

On-premises users and clients, like SAP HANA Studio, cannot reach the Overlay IP address 
because the AWS Virtual Private Network (VPN) gateway is not able to route traffic to the Overlay IP address. 
To overcome this limitation, refer to AWS' Overlay IP documentation and learn how to use native AWS services 
with the Overlay IP address for your on-premises clients and users:

* SAP on AWS High Availability with Overlay IP Address Routing: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sap/latest/sap-hana/sap-ha-overlay-ip.html

Below are the prerequisites which need to be met before starting the cluster implementation:

* Have an AWS account
* Have an AWS user with admin privileges, or alternatively, with permissions to:
**	Create or modify VPC Security Groups
** Modify AWS VPC Routing Tables
** Create IAM policies and attach them to IAM roles
** Create and Modify EC2 Instances

*	Understand your architecture:
**	Know your AWS Region and its AWS name
**	Know your VPC and its AWS VPC ID
** Know which Availability Zones you want to use in your VPC
** Have the VPC Subnet for each of the AZs:
*** Have one or more routing tables which are implicitly or explicitly attached to the two
subnets
*** Have free IP addresses in the two VPC Subnets
*** Allow network traffic in between the two subnets
*** Allow outgoing Internet access from the subnets

Use the checklist in the appendix to note down all information needed
before starting the installation.

=== Configuring security groups

The following ports and protocols must be configured to allow the two
cluster nodes to communicate with each other:

* Port 5405 for inbound UDP: Required by the cluster's communication layer (corosync).
* Port 7630 for inbound TCP: Used by the SUSE "HAWK" Web GUI.

It is assumed that there are no restriction for outbound network communication.

=== Creating an AWS EC2 instance

Create two EC2 instances to build up your SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension cluster.

The EC2 instances must be located in two different Availability Zones to make them independent of each other, 
and it is recommended to be one of the certified SAP HANA instances as per SAP HANA's Certified Hardware Directory:

- SAP HANA Certified Hardware Directory: https://www.sap.com/dmc/exp/2014-09-02-hana-hardware/enEN/iaas.html#categories=Amazon%20Web%20Services

There are two options for which Amazon Machine Image (AMI) to use:

* Use the AWS Marketplace AMI
_"SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications 15 SP1"_ which already includes the required SUSE subscription and all High Availability components for this solution.

* Use a "SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP" AMI. Search for _"suse-sles-sap-15-sp1-byos"_ in the list of AMIs. 
There are several BYOS (Bring Your Own Subscription) AMIs available. Use these AMIs if you have a valid SUSE subscription. 
Register your system with the Subscription Management Tool (SMT) from SUSE, SUSE Manager or directly with the SUSE Customer Center.

Launch all EC2 instances into the Availability Zones (AZ) specific subnets. The subnets need to be able to communicate with each other.

NOTE: It is not possible to migrate from standard _"SUSE Linux Enterprise Server"_ to
_"SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications"_ in AWS. Therefore, use a "SLES for SAP" AMI which includes the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension.

=== Changing host names

The EC2 instances will have host names which are automatically generated, and these automatically generated host names must be changed. 
Select host names which comply with SAP requirements, see SAP Note 611361. 

To change the host name you need to edit _/etc/cloud/cloud.cfg_ and change the option _preserve_hostname_ to _true_ for host names to persist:

.Option changed in cloud.cfg file
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
preserve_hostname: true
----

====

NOTE: To learn how to change the default host name for an EC2 instance running SUSE Linux Enterprise, refer to the AWS' public documentation at https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/linux-static-hostname-suse/.

=== Tagging the EC2 instances

The AWS EC2 STONITH agents use AWS resource tags to identify the EC2 instances.

Tag the two EC2 instances through the console or the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI)
with arbitrarily chosen tag like _pacemaker_ and the host name as it will be shown in the command
_uname_. Use the same tag (like _pacemaker_) and the individual host names for both instances.

To add a tag to an EC2 instance, refer to the AWS Documentation:
* Tagging your Amazon EC2 resources: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/Using_Tags.html

See an example screenshot after the EC2 instance has been tagged. A tag with the key pacemaker and the host name has been created.
The host name in this example is _suse-node52_.

.Tag EC2 instance
image::tagEC2Instance.png[tagEC2Inst,width="60%"]

Make sure that both EC2 instances part of the cluster are tagged.

NOTE: Use only ASCII characters in any AWS tag assigned to cluster managed resources.  

NOTE: Lowercase tags are expected by the resource agent. That is, a host name of 'NODE1' should have the tag 'node1'

=== AWS roles and policies

The SAP HANA database EC2 instances will run the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server cluster software and its agents. 
To operate the cluster correctly, it requires specific AWS IAM privileges.

Create a new IAM Role for every SAP HANA _cluster_ and associate this IAM Role to the two EC2 instances part of the cluster. 
Attach the following IAM Policies to this IAM Role.

==== AWS data provider policy

Every cluster node will operate an SAP system. SAP systems on AWS require the installation of the _“AWS Data Provider for SAP”_. 
The data provider needs a policy to pull information from AWS resources.

The policy shown below can be used by all SAP systems as the _“AWS Data Provider for SAP”_ can have only one policy per AWS account.
Therefore you can use an existing one, previously created for the _“AWS Data Provider for SAP”_, or create a new one.

The _"AWS Data Provider for SAP"_ IAM policy does not contain any EC2 instance specific privileges. 
Attach this IAM policy to the IAM role of the two cluster instances.

* AWS Data Provider for SAP: https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sap/latest/general/aws-data-provider.html

===== EC2 STONITH IAM permissions

The EC2 instances part of the cluster must have permission to make start and stop API calls to the other nodes in the cluster 
as part of the fencing operation. Create an IAM policy with a name like _EC2-stonith-policy_ with the following content and 
attach it to the cluster IAM Role:

            ]
        }
    ]

This policy allows the EC2 STONITH agent to make the proper API calls to operate correctly. From the above example, replace the following variables with the appropriate names:

- region-name : The name of the AWS region
- account-id : The number of the AWS account in which the policy is used
- instance-a and instance-b : The two EC2 instance IDs participating in the cluster

==== Overlay IP resource agent IAM policy

The Overlay IP resource agent must have permission to change a routing table entry in the AWS selected routing tables. 
Create an IAM policy with a name like _Manage-Overlay-IP-Policy_ and attach it to the IAM role of the cluster instances:

.IAM Policy for AWS IP Resource Agent
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor0",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:ReplaceRoute",
            "Resource": "arn:aws:ec2:region-name:account-id:route-table/rtb-XYZ"
        },
        {
            "Sid": "VisualEditor1",
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": "ec2:DescribeRouteTables",
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
----

====

This policy allows the agent to update the routing table(s) where the Overlay IP address has been configured. 
From the above example, replace the following variables with the appropriate names:

- region-name : The name of the AWS region
- account-id : The number of the AWS account in which the policy is used
- rtb-XYZ : the VPC routing table identifier to be configured by the cluster. It is possible to add more routing table IDs to the resource clause if you need to use multiple routing tables.

=== Adding Overlay IP addresses to routing tables

Manually add the Overlay IP address as a routing entry to the VPC routing tables which are assigned to the subnets. 
The Overlay IP address is the virtual service IP address of the SAP HANA cluster. 
The Overlay IP address needs to be outside of the CIDR range of the VPC.

To add the Overlay IP address:

* Use the AWS console and search for “VPC”.
* Select the correct VPC ID.
* Click “Route Tables” in the left column.
* Select the route table used by the subnets from one of your SAP EC2 instances and their application servers.
* Click the tabulator “Routes”.
* Click “Edit”.
* Scroll to the end of the list and click “Add another route”.
* Add the Overlay IP address of the SAP HANA database. Use as
filter /32 (example: 192.168.10.1/32). Add the Elastic Network Interface (ENI)
name to one of your existing instance. The resource agent will modify this later automatically.
* Save your changes by clicking “Save”.

NOTE: The VPC routing table containing the routing entry needs to be inherited to all subnets in the VPC which have consumers 
or clients of the service. Add more routing tables if required. Check the AWS VPC documentation
at http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonVPC/latest/UserGuide/VPC_Introduction.html for more details on routing table inheritance.

This section contains information you should consider during the
installation of the operating system.

For the scope of this document, first {sles4sap} is installed and configured. Then the {saphana}
database including the system replication is set up. Finally the
automation with the cluster is set up and configured.

// begin AWS
=== Configuring system logging

SUSE recommends to use `rsyslogd` for logging in the SUSE cluster. Despite of this being the default configuration on newer AMIs, 
some AWS AMIs may still be using `syslogd` logging.

Perform the following commands as _root_ on all cluster nodes:

.SLES15 rsyslog Installation
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> zypper install rsyslog
----

Depending on the installed packages a conflict may be shown, like the below example:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # zypper install rsyslog
Refreshing service 'SMT-http_smt-ec2_susecloud_net'.
Refreshing service 'cloud_update'.

 Solution 1: deinstallation of syslog-ng-3.6.4-11.1.x86_64
 Solution 2: do not install rsyslog-8.24.0-3.16.1.x86_64
Choose from above solutions by number or cancel [1/2/c] (c):
----

====

Select "Solution 1: deinstallation of syslog-ng", and then reboot both nodes.

Addicionally, some cluster components require `ha_logd` to properly log events, thus it needs to be set to start at boot:

.Enabling logd to start automatically
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> systemctl enable --now logd
----

====


=== Configuring the AWS CLI in the EC2 instances

The SUSE Linux Enterprise Server agents use the AWS Command Line Interface (CLI) as an
underlying tool to make AWS API calls.

It will use an AWS CLI profile which needs to be created for the user _root_ on both instances. 
The SUSE resources agents require a profile that creates output in text format. 

The name of the AWS CLI profile is arbitrary. The name chosen in this
example is _cluster_. The region of the instance needs to be added as well.
Replace the string _region-name_ with your target region in the following example.

One way to create such a profile is to create a file _/root/.aws/config_
with the following content:

.AWS CLI configuration file
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
[default]
region = region-name
[profile cluster]
region = region-name
output = text
----

====


The other way is to use the `aws configure` CLI command in the following way:

.AWS CLI profile creation
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# aws configure
AWS Access Key ID [None]:
AWS Secret Access Key [None]:
Default region name [None]: _region-name_
Default output format [None]:

# aws configure --profile cluster
AWS Access Key ID [None]:
AWS Secret Access Key [None]:
Default region name [None]: region-name
Default output format [None]: text
----

====


This command sequence generates a _default_ profile and a _cluster_ profile.

=== Configuring HTTP proxies

This action is not needed if the system has transparent access to the Internet.
The resource agents execute AWS CLI (Command Line Interface) commands. These
commands send HTTP/HTTPS requests to an access point in the Internet. These
access points are usually directly reachable. Systems which do not offer
transparent Internet access need to provide an HTTP/HTTPS proxy.
The configuration of the proxy access is described in full detail in the
AWS documentation.

Add the following environment variables to the root user's _.bashrc_ and to _/etc/sysconfig/pacemaker_ files:

.Environment variables for proxy
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
export HTTP_PROXY=http://a.b.c.d:n
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://a.b.c.d:m
export NO_PROXY=169.254.169.254
----

====

Add the following environment variables instead of the ones above if authentication is required:

.Environment variables for proxy with authentication
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
export HTTP_PROXY=http://username:password@a.b.c.d:n
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://username:password@a.b.c.d:m
export NO_PROXY=169.254.169.254
----

====

There is also the option to configure the proxy system wide, which is detailed in the following SUSE Support Knowledgebase article:
- SUSE Linux Enterprise : How to setup a Proxy manually (https://www.suse.com/support/kb/doc/?id=000017441)

==== Verifying HTTP proxy settings

Make sure that the EC2 instance is able to communicate with the EC2 metadata server URL at http://169.254.169.254/latest/meta-data.

An incorrect configuration will cause issues to the SUSE registration and to the EC2 STONITH agent.

====  Configuring the operating system for SAP HANA

The main installation guides for {sles4sap} that fit all requirements for {sapHana} are available from the SAP notes:

// SUSE and SAP are kept literal here not by the reference, because its a quote of an external title
- 2578899 SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 15: Installation Note and
- 2684254 SAP HANA DB: Recommended OS settings for SLES 15 / SLES for SAP applications 15.


=== Managing networking for cluster instances

==== Adding a second IP for each cluster instance

The cluster configuration will require two IP addresses per cluster instance, as corosync requires a redundant communication ring.

The redundant corosync ring configuration will allow the cluster nodes to communicate with each other using the secondary IP address 
if there is an issue communicating with each other over the primary IP address. This avoids unnecessary cluster failovers and split-brain situations.

Refer to AWS documentation at https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSEC2/latest/UserGuide/MultipleIP.html#assignIP-existing
to understand how to assign a secondary IP address.

After the secondary IP address is associated to the cluster instance in AWS, you need
to configure the secondary IP address in the cluster instance. Update the file
_/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0_ as shown below. Replace XX.XX.XX.XX with the new secondary IP address
and replace 'XX' with the two digit subnet mask.

.Secondary IP address configuration
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
IPADDR_1="XX.XX.XX.XX/XX"
LABEL_1="1"
----

====

The system will read the file and add the secondary IP address after the cluster instance
is rebooted. Additionally, executing the command below as root will add the IP address
to the cluster instance network stack without rebooting.

.Secondary IP address configuration
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
ip address add XX.XX.XX.XX/XX dev eth0
----

====

Replace _XX.XX.XX.XX_ with the new secondary IP address and replace _XX_ with the two digit subnet mask.

==== Disabling the source/destination check for the cluster instances

The source/destination check needs to be disabled. This can be done through scripts using the AWS CLI or by using the AWS console.

The following command needs to be executed one time for both EC2 instances that are part of the cluster:

.Disabling Source/Destination Check using AWS CLI
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# aws ec2 modify-instance-attribute --instance-id EC2-instance --no-source-dest-check
----

====

Replace the variable _EC2-instance_ with the EC2 instance IDs of the two cluster AWS EC2 instances.

The system on which this command gets executed needs temporarily a role with the following policy:

.IAM Policy required to change Source/Destination Check
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{
   "Version": "2012-10-17",
   "Statement": [
   {
      "Sid": "Stmt1424870324000",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Action": [ "ec2:ModifyInstanceAttribute" ],
      "Resource": [
      "arn:aws:ec2:region-name:account-id:instance/instance-a",
      "arn:aws:ec2:region-name:account-id:instance/instance-b"
      ]
   }
   ]
}
----

====


Replace the following individual parameter with the appropriate values:

- region-name : The name of the AWS region
- account-id : The number of the AWS account in which the policy is used
- instance-a and instance-b : The two EC2 instance IDs participating in the cluster

The source/destination check can be also disabled from the AWS console. It requires the following action in the console on both EC2 instances (see below).

.Disable Source/Destination Check at Console
image::SourceDestinationCheck.png[SourceDestinationCheck]

==== Avoiding deletion of cluster-managed IP address from the network interface

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server ships with the `cloud-netconfig-ec2` package which contains scripts to automatically configure network interfaces in an EC2 instance.

This package may remove secondary IP addresses which are managed by the cluster agents from the network interface. 
This can cause service interruptions for users of the cluster services. Perform the following task on all cluster nodes:

Check whether the package `cloud-netconfig-ec2` is installed with the command.

.Check if cloud-netconfig-ec2 is installed
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# zypper info cloud-netconfig-ec2
----

====


If this package is installed, update the file _/etc/sysconfig/network/ifcfg-eth0_ and change the following line to a *no* setting. 
If the package is not yet installed, add the following line:

.Disabling CLOUD_NETCONFIG_MANAGE
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
CLOUD_NETCONFIG_MANAGE='no'

//Installing the SAP HANA Databases on Both Cluster Nodes

image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase3.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

Even though this document focuses on the integration of an
installed {hana} with system replication already set up in the
pacemaker cluster, this section summarizes the test environment.
Always use the official documentation from SAP to install {hana} and to
set up the system replication.


.Preparation

* Read the SAP Installation and Setup Manuals available at the SAP Marketplace.

* Download the {hana} Software from SAP Marketplace.

.Actions

. Install the {hana} Database as described in the {hana} Server
Installation Guide.

. Check if the SAP Host Agent is installed on all cluster nodes. If this
SAP service is not installed, install it now.

. Verify that both databases are up and all processes of these databases
are running correctly.

As Linux user _<sid>adm_, use the command line tool _HDB_ to get an
overview of the running HANA processes. The output of `HDB` `info` should
be similar to the output shown below:

For more information, read the section _Setting Up System Replication_ of
the {hana} Administration Guide.

**Procedure**

. Back up the primary database.
. Enable the primary database.
. Register the secondary database.
. Verify the system replication.

=== Backing up the primary database

Back up the primary database as described in the {hana} Administration
Guide, section _{hana} Database Backup and Recovery_. We provide an
example with SQL commands. You need to adapt these backup commands to match your
backup infrastructure.

.Simple backup for the system database and all tenants with one single backup call
=========================
As user _{refsidadm}_ enter the following command:

----
hdbsql -u SYSTEM -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR FULL SYSTEM USING FILE ('backup')"
----

You get the following command output (or similar):

----
0 rows affected (overall time 15.352069 sec; server time 15.347745 sec)
----
=========================

.Simple backup for a single container (non MDC) database
=========================
Enter the following command as user _{refsidadm}_:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
hdbsql -i {refInst} -u <dbuser> \
   "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('backup')"
----
=========================

IMPORTANT: Without a valid backup, you cannot bring {hana} into a system
replication configuration.

=== Enabling the primary node

As Linux user _<sid>adm_ enable the system replication at the
primary node. You need to define a site name (like {sapsite1}). This
site name must be unique for all {hana} databases which are connected
via system replication. This means the secondary must have a different
site name.

NOTE: Do not use strings like "primary" and "secondary" as site names.

.Enable the Primary
==========
Enable the primary using the `-sr_enable` option.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name={sapsite1}
checking local nameserver:
checking for active nameserver ...
nameserver is running, proceeding ...
configuring ini files ...
successfully enabled system as primary site ...
done.
----
==========

.Check SR Configuration on the Primary
==========
Check the primary using the command `hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration`.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration --sapcontrol=1
SAPCONTROL-OK: <begin>
mode=primary
site id=1
site name={sapsite1}
SAPCONTROL-OK: <end>
done.
----
==========

The mode has changed from “none” to “primary” and the site now has a
site name and a site ID.

=== Registering the secondary node

The {hana} database instance on the secondary side must be stopped
before the instance can be registered for the system replication. You
can use your preferred method to stop the instance (like `HDB` or
`sapcontrol`). After the database instance has been stopped
successfully, you can register the instance using `hdbnsutil`. Again,
use Linux user _<sid>adm_:

.Stop the Secondary
==========
To stop the secondary you can use the command line tool _HDB_.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode2}:~> HDB stop
----
==========

.Copy the KEY and KEY-DATA file from the primary to the secondary site
==========
Beginning with {hana} 2.0 the system replication is running encrypted. This
is why the key files needs to copied-over from the primary to the secondary
site.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
cd /usr/sap/{refSID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs
rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/data/SSFS_{refSID}.DAT
rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/key/SSFS_{refSID}.KEY
----
==========

.Register the Secondary
==========
The registration of the secondary is triggered by calling `hdbnsutil -sr_register ..._.`.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
...
{sapnode2}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_register --name={sapsite2} \
     --remoteHost={sapnode1} --remoteInstance={sapino} \
     --replicationMode=sync --operationMode=logreplay
adding site ...
checking for inactive nameserver ...
nameserver {sapnode2}:30001 not responding.
collecting information ...
updating local ini files ...
done.
----
==========

The _remoteHost_ is the primary node in our case, the _remoteInstance_ is
the database instance number (here {sapino}).

Now start the database instance again and verify the system replication
status. On the secondary node, the mode should be one of "SYNC" or
"SYNCMEM". "ASYNC" is also a possible replication mode *but not supported with
automated cluster takeover*. The mode depends on the *sync* option defined during
the registration of the secondary.

.Start Secondary and Check SR Configuration
==========
To start the new secondary use the command line tool _HDB_. Then check the
SR configuration using `hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration`.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode2}:~> HDB start
...
{sapnode2}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration --sapcontrol=1
SAPCONTROL-OK: <begin>
mode=sync
site id=2
site name={sapsite2}
active primary site=1
primary masters={sapnode1}
SAPCONTROL-OK: <end>
done.
----
==========


To view the replication state of the whole {hana} cluster use the
following command as _<sid>adm_ user on the primary node:

.Checking System Replication Status Details
==========
The python script _systemReplicationStatus.py_ provides details about the current
system replication.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py --sapcontrol=1
...
site/2/SITE_NAME=ROT1
site/2/SOURCE_SITE_ID=1
site/2/REPLICATION_MODE=SYNC
site/2/REPLICATION_STATUS=ACTIVE
site/1/REPLICATION_MODE=PRIMARY
site/1/SITE_NAME=WDF1
local_site_id=1
...
----
==========

=== Manually testing SAP HANA SR takeover

Before you integrate your SAP HANA system replication into the cluster,
it is mandatory to do a manual takeover. Testing without the cluster helps to make sure that
basic operation (takeover and registration) is working as expected.

* Stop {hana} on node 1

* Takeover {hana} to node 2

* Register node 1 as secondary

* Start {hana} on node 1

* Wait till sync state is active

=== Optional: Manually re-establishing SAP HANA SR to original state

Bring the systems back to the original state:

* Stop {hana} on node 2

* Takeover {hana} to node 1

* Register node 2 as secondary

* Start {hana} on node2

* Wait until sync state is active

== {stepHook}

image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase5.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

// DONE: Feedback ps: explain better, when the python hook is needed.

This step is mandatory to inform the cluster immediately if the secondary gets out of sync.
The hook is called by {SAPHANA} using the HA/DR provider interface in point-of-time when the secondary gets out of
sync. This is typically the case when the first commit pending is released. The hook is
called by {SAPHANA} again when the system replication is back.

**Procedure**

. Implement the python hook SAPHanaSR.
. Configure the system replication operation mode.
. Allow _{refsidadm}_ to access the cluster.
. Start {saphana}.
. Test the hook integration.

=== Implementing the Python hook SAPHanaSR

This step must be done on both sites. {SAPHANA} must be stopped to change the
_global.ini_ file and allow {SAPHANA} to integrate the HA/DR hook script during start.

- Install the HA/DR hook script into a read/writable directory.
- Integrate the hook into the _global.ini_ file ({saphana} needs to be stopped for doing that offline).
- Check integration of the hook during start-up.

Use the hook from the SAPHanaSR package (available since version 0.153). Optionally copy it to your preferred
directory like _/hana/share/myHooks_. The hook must be available on all SAP HANA cluster nodes.

{mySite1FirstNode}~ # chown -R {refsidadm}:sapsys /hana/shared/myHooks
----
////

.Stop {hana}
===================================
Stop {SAPHANA} either with _HDB_ or using `sapcontrol`.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----

[ha_dr_provider_SAPHanaSR]
provider = SAPHanaSR
path = /usr/share/SAPHanaSR
execution_order = 1

[trace]
ha_dr_saphanasr = info
----
===================================

=== Configuring system replication operation mode

When your system is connected as an {sapHanaSR} target you can find an entry in the _global.ini_
file which defines the operation mode. Up to now there are the following modes available:

* _delta_datashipping_
* _logreplay_
* _logreplay_readaccess_

Until a takeover and re-registration in the opposite direction, the entry for the operation mode is missing on
your primary site. The first operation mode which was available was _delta_datashipping_. Today the preferred modes for HA are
_logreplay_ or _logreplay_readaccess_. Using the operation mode _logreplay_ makes your secondary site in the {saphana}
system replication a hot standby system.
For more details regarding all operation modes check the available SAP documentation such as
"How To Perform System Replication for SAP HANA".

.Checking the Operation Mode
===================================
Check both _global.ini_ files and add the operation mode if needed.

section:: [ system_replication ]
entry:: operation_mode = logreplay

Path for the _global.ini_: /hana/shared/<SID>/global/hdb/custom/config/
----
[system_replication]
operation_mode = logreplay
----
===================================

=== Allowing {refsidadm} to access the cluster

The current version of the SAPHanaSR python hook uses the command `sudo` to allow
the _{refsidadm}_ user to access the cluster attributes. In Linux you can use `visudo`
to start the vi editor for the _/etc/sudoers_ configuration file.

The user _{refsidadm}_ must be able to set the cluster attributes `hana_{refsidLC}_site_srHook_*`.
The {SAPHANA} system replication hook needs password free access. The following
example limits the sudo access to exactly setting the needed attribute.

Replace the {refsidLC} by the *lowercase* SAP system ID (like `{sapssid}`).

.Entry in sudo permissions /etc/sudoers file
===================================
Basic sudoers entry to allow <sidadm> to use the srHook.

// command to be allowed used in the hook:
// "sudo /usr/sbin/crm_attribute -n hana_%s_site_srHook_%s -v %s -t crm_config -s SAPHanaSR"

----

More specific sudoers entries to meet a high security level:
All *Cmnd_Alias* entries must be each defined as a single line entry.
In the following example the lines might include a line break forced by document formatting. In our example we have
four separate lines with Cmnd_Alias entries, one line for the _{refsidadm}_ user and one or more lines for comments.

This chapter describes the configuration of the cluster software SUSE
Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension, which is part of the SUSE
Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications, and {hana} Database
Integration.

// DONE PRIO1: Do we need to move that *before* we set-up the srHook?

. Basic Cluster Configuration

. Configure Cluster Properties and Resources


=== Installation

// begin AWS

AWS "SLES for SAP" AMIs already have all High Availability Extension packages installed.

It is recommended to update all packages to make sure that the latest revision of the cluster packages and AWS agents are installed.

=== Configuring the basic cluster

The first step is to set up the basic cluster framework.

==== Configuring corosync

By default, the cluster service (pacemaker) is disabled and not set to start during boot. Thus at this point the cluster should not be running. 
However, if you previously configured pacemaker and it is running, proceed with a "stop" by using the following command:

.Stopping the cluster
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # systemctl stop pacemaker
----
====


The cluster service (pacemaker) status can be checked with:


.Checking cluster status
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # systemctl status pacemaker
----

====


==== Creating keys

On Node 1, generate a corosync secret key used to encrypt all cluster communication:

.Generating corosync security keys
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~# corosync-keygen
----

====


A new key file will be created on _/etc/corosync/authkey_, and this file needs to be copied to the same location on Node 2. 
After generating and transferring the key file to the second node, verify that permissions and ownerships on both nodes are the same:

.Checking permissions and ownership for corosync key file
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # ls -l /etc/corosync/authkey
-r-------- 1 root root 128 Oct 23 10:51 /etc/corosync/authkey
----

====


==== Creating the corosync configuration file

The corosync configuration will leverage both IP addresses associated to each cluster node. 
The two IP configurations will use the second IP if the primary IP addresses for the two node cluster are no longer able to communicate with each other.

All cluster nodes are required to have a local configuration file _"/etc/corosync/corosync.conf"_ 
where the relevant information is being located in the two sections describing _interface_ and _nodelist_. 
The other entries can be configured as needed for a specific implementation.

AWS requires a specific corosync configuration, which can be structured as the example below.

NOTE: When using the following configuration as an example for the file _/etc/corosync/corosync.conf_. 
Replace the IP addresses from the file below.

.Sample corosyc.conf file

   }
   node {

# see also corosync.conf.5 and votequorum.5
   provider: corosync_votequorum
   expected_votes: 2
   two_node: 1
}
----

====

Replace the variables _ip-node-1-a_,  _ip-node-1-b_, _ip-node-2-a_,  _ip-node-2-b_ and _ip-local-node_ from the above sample file.

* *[.underline]#ip-local-node#*: Use the IP address of the node where the file is being configured. This IP will be different between cluster nodes.
* *[.underline]#ip-node-1-a#*: Primary IP address of cluster node node-1
* *[.underline]#ip-node-1-b#*: Secondary IP address of cluster node node-1
* *[.underline]#ip-node-2-a#*: Primary IP address of cluster node node-2
* *[.underline]#ip-node-2-b#*: Secondary IP address of cluster node node-2

The chosen settings for _crypto_cipher_ and _crypto_hash_ are suitable for clusters in AWS. 
They may be modified according to SUSE's documentation if strong encryption of cluster communication is desired.

// end AWS

NOTE: Remember to change the password of the user [.underline]#hacluster#

==== Checking the cluster for the first time

Now it is time to check and start the cluster for the first time on both nodes.

.Starting the cluster on both cluster nodes
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # {clusterstatus}
{sapnode2}:~ # {clusterstatus}
{sapnode1}:~ # {clusterstart}
{sapnode2}:~ # {clusterstart}
----

====


Check the cluster status with `crm_mon`. We use the option `-r` to also see resources which may be configured but stopped. 
But at this stage `crm_mon` is expected to display no services.

.Checking cluster status using crm_mon
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm_mon -r
----

====


The command will show the "empty" cluster and will print something like the computer output shown below. 
The most interesting information for now is that there are two nodes in the status "online" and the message "partition with quorum".

// begin AWS
.Cluster status after first start
====

----

====

Corosync's redundant ring configuration can be checked with the command:

.Corosync redundant ring status
====
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
corosync-cfgtool -s
----

This will display a result like the following one for a cluster node with redundant corosync rings and IP addresses 172.16.100.179 and 172.16.100.138:

// begin; AWS
[subs="attributes"]
----

	id	= 172.16.100.138
	status	= ring 1 active with no faults
----

====
// end; AWS


NOTE: It is not recommended to automatically rejoin a node to a cluster after a system crash with a reboot. 
A full inspection and a root cause analysis of the crash is highly recommended before rejoining the cluster.


=== Configuring cluster properties and resources

This section describes how to configure constraints, resources, bootstrap and STONITH using the `crm configure` shell command as described
in section _Configuring and Managing Cluster Resources (Command Line)_ of the {uarr}SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension documentation.

Use the command `crm` to add the objects to CRM. Copy the following examples to a local file, edit the file and then load the configuration to the CIB:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # vi crm-fileXX
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-fileXX
----

==== Cluster bootstrap and more

The first example defines the cluster bootstrap options, the resource and operation defaults.

// begin AWS

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # vi crm-bs.txt
# enter the following to the file crm-bs.txt
property $id="cib-bootstrap-options" \
   stonith-enabled="true" \
   stonith-action="off" \
   stonith-timeout="600s"
rsc_defaults $id="rsc-options" \
   resource-stickiness="1000" \
   migration-threshold="5000"
op_defaults $id="op-options" \
   timeout="600"
----

NOTE: In some older SUSE versions, the parameter _stonith-action_ may require a change to `stonith-action="poweroff"`.

The setting _off_ forces the EC2 STONITH agent to shut down the EC2 instance in case of fencing operation. 
This is desirable to avoid split brain scenarios on the AWS platform.
// end AWS

Now, add the configuration to the cluster:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-bs.txt
----

==== STONITH device

// begin AWS

The next configuration part defines an AWS EC2 STONITH resource.

// end AWS

// begin AWS

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}::~ # vi aws-stonith.txt
# enter the following to the file aws-stonith.txt
primitive res_AWS_STONITH stonith:external/ec2 \
    op start interval=0 timeout=180 \
    op stop interval=0 timeout=180 \
    op monitor interval=120 timeout=60 \
    meta target-role=Started \
    params tag=pacemaker profile=cluster pcmk_delay_max=15
----

The _"tag=pacemaker"_ entry needs to match the tag chosen for the EC2 instances. 
The value for this tag will contain the host name returned by the `uname -n` command. 
The name of the profile ("cluster" in this example) needs to match the previously configured profile in the AWS CLI.

Name this file for example _aws-stonith.txt_ and add this file to the configuration. 
The following command needs to be issued as _root_ user:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update aws-stonith.txt
----

// end AWS

// begin AWS
A working STONITH method is mandatory to run a supported SUSE cluster on AWS.

NOTE: Make sure to execute the STONITH tests as outlined in section _Troubleshooting_ of this document to verify STONITH on both nodes.

====  Configuring the Overlay IP address 

This step requires the Overlay IP address and the resource IDs of the AWS VPC Route Table(s). Create a file with the following content:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # vi aws-move-ip.txt
# enter the following to the file aws-move-ip.txt
primitive res_AWS_IP ocf:suse:aws-vpc-move-ip \
   params ip=overlay-ip-address routing_table=rtb-table interface=eth0 profile=cluster \
   op start interval=0 timeout=180 \
   op stop interval=0 timeout=180 \
   op monitor interval=60 timeout=60
----

Replace the following individual parameter with the appropriate values:

- _overlay-ip-address_ : the Overlay IP address used
- _rtb-table_ : The AWS VPC Route Table(s) resource ids - if using more than one VPC Route Table use comma (,) as a separator (see below).
- _interface_ : The Linux' network interface identificator
- _profile_ : The name of the profile (cluster in this example) needs to match the previously configured profile in the AWS CLI.

Load this file into the cluster configuration by issuing the following command as super user:
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update aws-move-ip.txt
----

Optionally, it is possible to specify multiple routing tables in the primitive configuration separated by a comma (,), 
as shown in the following example:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # vi aws-move-ip.txt
# enter the following to the file aws-move-ip.txt
primitive res_AWS_IP ocf:suse:aws-vpc-move-ip \
   params ip=overlay-ip-address routing_table=rtb-table-1,rtb-table-2,rtb-table-N interface=eth0 profile=cluster \
   op start interval=0 timeout=180 \
   op stop interval=0 timeout=180 \
   op monitor interval=60 timeout=60
----

NOTE: Make sure to execute the IP tests as outlined in section _Troubleshooting_ of this document to verify them on both nodes.
Checking the configuration for potential problems at current point in time will increase the chances to launch the cluster successfully.

// end AWS

==== SAPHanaTopology

Next we define the group of resources needed, before the HANA instances
can be started. Prepare the changes in a text file, for example
_crm-saphanatop.txt_, and load it with the command:

`crm configure load update crm-saphanatop.txt`

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-saphanatop.txt
# enter the following to crm-saphanatop.txt
primitive rsc_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} ocf:suse:SAPHanaTopology \
        op monitor interval="10" timeout="600" \
        op start interval="0" timeout="600" \
        op stop interval="0" timeout="300" \
        params SID="{sapsid}" InstanceNumber="{sapino}"
clone cln_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} rsc_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} \
        meta clone-node-max="1" interleave="true"
----

Additional information about all parameters can be found with the command:

`man ocf_suse_SAPHanaTopology`

Again, add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-saphanatop.txt
----

The most important parameters here are SID and InstanceNumber, which are
quite self-explaining in the SAP context. Beside these parameters, the
timeout values or the operations (start, monitor, stop) are typical
tunables.

==== SAPHana

Next, define the group of resources needed, before the HANA instances
can be started. Edit the changes in a text file, for example
_crm-saphana.txt_, and load it with the command:

`crm configure load update crm-saphana.txt`

// are explained well

.Description of important Resource Agent parameters
[width="100%",cols="42%,58%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER |Defines whether RA should prefer to takeover to
the secondary instance instead of restarting the failed primary locally.

|AUTOMATED_REGISTER a|
Defines whether a former primary should be automatically registered to
be secondary of the new primary. With this parameter you can adapt the
level of system replication automation.

If set to `false`, the former primary must be manually registered. The
cluster will not start this SAP HANA RDBMS until it is registered to avoid
double primary up situations.

|DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT |Time difference needed between two primary
time stamps if a dual-primary situation occurs. If the time difference
is less than the time gap, then the cluster hold one or both instances
in a "WAITING" status. This is to give an administrator the chance to react on a
fail-over. If the complete node of the former primary crashed, the former
primary will be registered after the time difference is passed. If
"only" the SAP HANA RDBMS has crashed, then the former primary will be
registered immediately. After this registration to the new primary all
data will be overwritten by the system replication.
|=======================================================================

Additional information about all parameters could be found with the command:

`man ocf_suse_SAPHana`

[subs="attributes,quotes"]

----

Add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-saphana.txt
----

The most important parameters here are again SID and InstanceNumber.
Beside these parameters, the timeout values for the operations (start,
promote, monitors, stop) are typical tunables.

==== Constraints

Two constraints are organizing the correct placement of the Overlay IP
address for the client database access and the start order between the
two resource agents SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-cs.txt
# enter the following to crm-cs.txt

order ord_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} Optional: cln_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} \
    msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}
----

Load the file to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-cs.txt
----

==== Active/active read-enabled scenario

This step is optional. If you have an active/active {saphana} system
replication with a read-enabled secondary, it is possible to integrate the
needed second virtual IP address into the cluster. This is done by adding
a second virtual IP address resource and a location constraint binding the
address to the secondary site.

The lists of tests will be enhanced with future updates of this document.

As with any cluster testing is crucial. Make sure that all test
cases derived from customer expectations are implemented and fully passed. 
Otherwise the project is likely to fail in production.

The test prerequisite, if not described differently, is always that both
nodes are booted, normal members of the cluster and the HANA RDBMS is
running. The system replication is in sync (SOK).

=== Test cases for semi automation

In the following test descriptions we assume the following values:

`PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER="true"` and `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"`

NOTE: The following tests are designed to run in a sequence. They depend
on the exit state of the proceeding tests.

[[cha.hana-sr.administrate]]
== Administration

=== Dos and don'ts

In your project, you should:

* define STONITH before adding other resources to the cluster
* do intensive testing.
* tune the timeouts of operations of SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology.
* start with the values PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER=”true”, AUTOMATED_REGISTER=”false” and
DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT=”7200”.

In your project, avoid:

* rapidly changing/changing back cluster configuration, such as setting
nodes to standby and online again or stopping/starting the multi-state 
resource.
* creating a cluster without proper time synchronization or unstable
name resolutions for hosts, users and groups.
* adding location rules for the clone, multi-state or IP resource. Only
location rules mentioned in this setup guide are allowed.
* "migrating" or "moving" resources in crm-shell, HAWK or other tools
because this would add client-prefer location rules. Thus, these activities are completely
forbidden.

=== Monitoring and tools

You can use the High Availability Web Console (HAWK), {hana} Studio and
different command line tools for cluster status requests.

==== HAWK – cluster status and more

You can use an Internet browser to check the cluster status.

// DONE PRIO1: We need a SLE15 HAWK screenshot here

.Cluster Status in HAWK
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUp-HAWK-Status-SLE12.png[scaledwidth=100%]

If you set up the cluster using {slehainit} and you have installed all
packages as described above, your system will provide a very useful Web
interface. You can use this graphical Web interface to get an overview
of the complete cluster status, perform administrative tasks or configure 
resources and cluster bootstrap parameters. Read the product
manuals for a complete documentation of this powerful user interface.

==== {hana} Studio

Database-specific administration and checks can be done with {hana} studio.

// TODO PRIO1: We need a HANA Cockpit screen-shot here

.{hana} Studio – Landscape
image::hana_studio_landscape.png[scaledwidth=100%]

==== Cluster command line tools

A simple overview can be obtained by calling `crm_mon`. Using option
`-r` shows also stopped but already configured resources. Option `-1`
tells `crm_mon` to output the status once instead of periodically.

----

See the manual page crm_mon(8) for details.

==== SAPHanaSR command line tools

To show some SAPHana or SAPHanaTopology resource agent internal
values, you can call the program `SAPHanaSR-showAttr`. The internal
values, the storage location and their parameter names may change in the next
versions of this document. The command `SAPHanaSR-showAttr` will always fetch the values
from the correct storage location.

Do not use cluster commands like `crm_attribute` to fetch the values
directly from the cluster. If you use such commands, your methods will be
broken when you need to move an attribute to a different storage place
or even out of the cluster. At first, _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ is a test
program only and should not be used for automated system monitoring.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
 {sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-showAttr
 Host \ Attr clone_state remoteHost roles       ... site    srmode sync_state ...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {sapnode1}      PROMOTED    {sapnode2}     4:P:master1:... {sapsite1}      sync  PRIM       ...
 {sapnode2}      DEMOTED     {sapnode1}     4:S:master1:... {sapsite2}      sync  SOK        ...
----

`SAPHanaSR-showAttr` also supports other output formats such as *script*. The script
format is intended to allow running filters. The SAPHanaSR package beginning with
version 0.153 also provides a filter engine `SAPHanaSR-filter`. In combination of
`SAPHanaSR-showAttr` with output format script and `SAPHanaSR-filter` you can define
effective queries:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-showAttr --format=script | \
   SAPHanaSR-filter --search='remote'
Thu Feb  6 12:28:10 2020; Hosts/{sapnode1}/remoteHost={sapnode2}
Thu Feb  6 12:28:10 2020; Hosts/{sapnode2}/remoteHost={sapnode1}
----

`SAPHanaSR-replay-archive` can help to analyze the SAPHanaSR attribute values from
`hb_report` (`crm_report`) archives. This allows post mortem analyses.

In our example, the administrator killed the primary {hana} instance using the command
`HDB kill-9`. This happened around 9:10 pm.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # hb_report -f 19:00
INFO: {sapnode1}# The report is saved in ./hb_report-1-11-11-2019.tar.bz2
INFO: {sapnode1}# Report timespan: 11/11/19 19:00:00 - 11/11/19 21:05:33
INFO: {sapnode1}# Thank you for taking time to create this report.
{sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-replay-archive --format=script \
    ./hb_report-1-11-11-2019.tar.bz2 | \
    SAPHanaSR-filter --search='roles' --filterDouble
Mon Nov 11 20:38:01 2019; Hosts/{sapnode1}/roles=4:P:master1:master:worker:master
Mon Nov 11 20:38:01 2019; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=4:S:master1:master:worker:master
Mon Nov 11 21:11:37 2019; Hosts/{sapnode1}/roles=1:P:master1::worker:
Mon Nov 11 21:12:43 2019; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=4:P:master1:master:worker:master
----

In the above example the attributes indicate that at the beginning {sapnode1}
was running primary (4:P) and {sapnode2} was running secondary (4:S).

At 21:11 (CET) suddenly the primary on {sapnode1} died - it was falling down to 1:P.

The cluster did jump-in and initiated a takeover. At 21:12 (CET) the former secondary
was detected as new running master (changing from 4:S to 4:P).


==== {hana} LandscapeHostConfiguration

To check the status of an SAPHana database and to find out if the
cluster should react, you can use the script *landscapeHostConfiguration*
to be called as Linux user _<sid>adm_.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----

{sapnode1}:~> HDBSettings.sh landscapeHostConfiguration.py
| Host   | Host   | ... NameServer   | NameServer  | IndexServer | IndexServer |
|        | Active | ... Config Role  | Actual Role | Config Role | Actual Role |
| ------ | ------ | ... ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| {sapnode1} | yes    | ... master 1     | master      | worker      | master      |

overall host status: ok
----

Following the SAP HA guideline, the SAPHana resource agent interprets
the return codes in the following way:

.Interpretation of Return Codes
[width="100%",cols="15%,85%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Return Code |Interpretation
|4 |{hana} database is up and OK. The cluster does interpret this as a
correctly running database.

|3 |{hana} database is up and in status info. The cluster does
interpret this as a correctly running database.

|2 |{hana} database is up and in status warning. The cluster does
interpret this as a correctly running database.

|1 |{hana} database is down. If the database should be up and is not
down by intention, this could trigger a takeover.

|0 |Internal Script Error – to be ignored.
|=======================================================================

=== Maintenance

To receive updates for the operating system or the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension,
it is recommended to register your systems to either a local SUSE Manager or Repository Mirroring Tool (RMT) or remotely with SUSE Customer Center.

==== Updating the operating system and cluster

For an update of {sles4sap} packages including cluster software follow the
rolling update procedure defined in the {sle} {ha} Extension product documentation,  
detailed in section _Upgrading Your Cluster and Updating Software Packages_ of the
SUSE Linux Enterprise {ha} Administration Guide.

==== Updating {hana} - seamless {hana} maintenance

For updating SAP HANA database systems in system replication you need to
follow the defined SAP processes. This section describes the steps to be
done before and after the update procedure to get the system replication
automated again.

{SUSE} has optimized the {hana} maintenance process in the cluster.
The improved procedure only sets the multi-state-resource to maintenance and
keeps the rest of the cluster (SAPHanaTopology clones and IPaddr2 vIP resource)
still active. Using the updated procedure allows a seamless {hana} maintenance
in the cluster as the Overlay IP address can automatically follow the running
primary.

//TODO: PRIO2 HINT for new wizard?!?!?!

Prepare the cluster not to react on the maintenance work to be done on
the SAP HANA database systems. Set the multi-state-resource to be
unmanaged and the cluster nodes in maintenance mode.


// DONE PRIO1: Check, if command 'cleanup' is still valid (see discussion with E&I)
//             'cleanup' replaced by 'refresh'

.Main {hana} Update procedure
==============================
Pre Update Task:: For the <multi-state-resource> set the maintenance mode:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource>
----
+
The <multi-state-resource> in the given guide is `msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}`.

Update:: Process the SAP Update for both SAP HANA database systems. This
procedure is described by SAP.

Post Update Task:: Expect the primary/secondary roles to be exchanged
after the maintenance. Therefore, tell the cluster to forget about these states and to
reprobe the updated SAP HANA database systems.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource refresh <multi-state-resource>
----
+
After the SAP HANA update is complete on both sites, tell the cluster
about the end of the maintenance process. This allows the cluster to
actively control and monitor the {sap} again.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource> off
----

==============================

==== Migrating an {HANA} primary

In the following procedures, we assume the primary to be running on node 1
and the secondary on node 2. The goal is to "exchange" the roles of the
nodes, so finally the primary should run on node 2 and the secondary
should run on node 1.

There are different methods to get the exchange of the roles done. The
following procedure shows how to tell the cluster to "accept" a role
change via native HANA commands.

// TODO PRIO1: Check for takeover with handshake

.Migrating an {HANA} primary using {sap} Toolset
==============================
Pre move:: Set the <multi-state-resource> to be maintenance. This could be done on any
cluster node.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource-name>
----

// TODO PRIO1: Check -sr_takeover with 'hands-chake'

example on node 1 as user _<sid>adm_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----

----

Post Migrate::
* Wait some time until _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ shows both SAP HANA database
systems to be up again (field roles must start with the digit 4). The new
secondary should have role "S" (for secondary).
+
* Tell the cluster to forget about the former multi-state roles and to
re-monitor the failed master. The command could be submitted on any
cluster node as user _root_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource refresh multi-state-resource-name
----
+
* Set the <multi-state-resource> to the status managed again. The command
could be submitted on any cluster node as user _root_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource-name> off
----
==============================

Now we explain how to use the cluster to partially automate the
migration. For the described attribute query using _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ and
_SAPHanaSR-filter_ you need at least SAPHanaSR with package version 0.153.

.Moving an {HANA} primary using the Cluster Toolset
==============================
* Create a "move away" from this node rule by using the *force* option.
+
[subs="attributes,specialchars,quotes"]
----
crm resource move <multi-state-resource-name> *force*
----
+
Because of the "move away" (*force*) rule the cluster will *stop* the
current primary. After that, run a *promote* on the secondary site if the system
replication was in sync before. You should not migrate the primary if
the status of the system replication is not in sync (SFAIL).
+
IMPORTANT: Migration without the *force* option will cause a takeover without the
former primary to be stopped. Only the migration with *force* option is supported.
+
NOTE: The crm resource command `move` was previously named `migrate`. The `migrate`
command is still valid but already known as obsolete.

* Wait until the secondary has completely taken over to be the new primary role. You
  see this using the command line tool _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ and check for the
  attributes "roles" for the new primary. It must start with "*4:P*".

----

* If you have set up `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`, you can skip this step. In
other cases you now need to register the old primary. Enter the command

NOTE: The `crm` resource command `clear` was previously named `unmigrate`. The `unmigrate`
command is still valid but already known as obsolete.

* Wait until the new secondary has started. You
  see this using the command line tool _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ and check for the
  attributes "roles" for the new primary. It must start with "*4:S*".

==============================

////
* Set the primary node to be standby.

`crm node standby {sapnode1}`

The cluster will stop the primary SAP HANA database and, if the system
replication was in sync, process the takeover on the secondary site.

Wait until the former secondary has completely taken over to be the new
primary.

If you have set up `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`, you can skip this step. In
other cases you now need to register the old primary. Enter the command
in our example on node1 as user _<sid>adm_.

// DONE PRIO1: HANA 2.0 command?!?!?!

`hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost={sapnode2} --remoteInstance={sapino} --replicationMode=sync --name={sapsite1} --operationMode=logreplay`

Set the standby node to be online again.

`crm node online {sapnode1}`

=== Example cluster configuration

The following complete `crm` configuration is for a two-node cluster (suse01,
suse02) and an SAP HANA database with SID HA1 and instance number 10. The
virtual IP address in the example is 192.168.10.15.
