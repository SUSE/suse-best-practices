== About this guide

=== Introduction

{sles4sapReg} is optimized in various
ways for SAP* applications. This guide provides detailed information about
installing and customizing _{sles4sap}_
for {saphana} scale-out system replication automation in the performance
optimized scenario.

High availability is an important aspect of running your mission-critical
{saphana} servers.

The {saphana} scale-out system replication is a synchronization of all data in
{saphana} to a second {saphana} system. The {saphana} itself replicates all of
its data to a secondary {saphana} instance. It is an out-of-the-box, standard
feature.

The recovery time objective (RTO) is minimized through the data replication at
regular intervals. {saphana} supports asynchronous and synchronous modes. The document
at hand describes the synchronous replication from memory into memory of the second
system. This is the only method that allows the cluster to make a
decision based on coded algorithms.

== Scope of this documentation
This document describes how to set up an automation of an {saphana} scale-out
system replication cluster installed on two sites based on {sles4sap} 12 SP2.
This concept can also be used with {sles4sap} 12 SP3 or newer.

To give a better overview the installation and setup is subdivided into
seven steps.

- OS setup (section <<OsSetup>>)
- {saphana} installation (section <<SAPHanaInst>>)
- {saphana} system replication configuration (section <<SAPHanaHsr>>)
- {saphana} cluster integration (section <<Integration>>)
- {sles4sapAbbr} cluster configuration (section <<Cluster>>)
- Testing (section <<Testing>>)

After the setup process you will have a {sles4sap} cluster controlling
two 'swarms' of {saphana} scale-out in a system replication configuration. The architecture
is named the 'performance optimized scenario'.

== Planning the installation

[[Planning]] Planning the installation is essential for a successful {saphana} cluster setup.

What you need before you start:
// TODO PRIO3: (all) should we change from NFS to something more neutral in the following list like replacing 'NFS storage pools' by 'SAP HANA certified storage pools'?

- Software from {suse}: {sles4sap} installation media and a valid subscription
  for getting updates
- Software from {sap}: {saphana} installation media
- Physical or virtual systems including disks and NFS storage pools (see below)
- Filled parameter sheet (see below)

=== Minimum lab requirements and prerequisites

This section defines some minimum requirements to install {saphana} scale-out.


NOTE: The minimum lab requirements mentioned here are no SAP sizing information.
These data are provided only to rebuild the described cluster in a lab for test purposes.
Even for such tests the requirements can increase depending on your test scenario.
For productive systems ask your hardware vendor or use the official SAP sizing
tools and services.

NOTE: Refer to {saphana} TDI documentation for allowed storage
configuration and file systems.

// DONE PRIO1: (FH) PICTURE FOR FIRST SETUP (2+1:2+3)

Requirements with 3 SAP instances per site (2+1 : 2+1) - with a
majority maker:

- 6 VMs with each 32 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space
- 1 VM with 2 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space
- 1 shared disk for SBD with 10 MB disk space
- 2 NFS pools (one per site) with a capacity of each 96 GB
- 1 additional IP address for takeover

// DONE PRIO1: (FH) PICTURE FOR SECOND SETUP (3+2: 3+2)

.Simplified NFS share structure of a 3+2:3+2 {saphana} system replication
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-NFSPool-3+2.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

Requirements with 5 {SAPHANA} instances per site (3+2 : 3+2) -
with a majority maker:

- 10 VMs with each 32 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space
- 1 VM with 2 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space
- 1 shared disk for SBD with 10 MB disk space
- 2 NFS pools (one per site) with a capacity of each 132 GB
- 1 additional IP address for takeover

// pools size is calculated like:
//     shared = 1 * MEM
//     data   = NODES * 1   * MEM
//     log    =  NODES * 1/2 * MEM
//     pool = shared + data + log

// DONE PRIO1: Table with parameter sheet

//For the SBD based fencing the setup needs a pool (1 up to 3) of shared
//disks to allow the transportation of the "poison pills".

The SBD based fencing needs up to 3 shared block devices.

.Additionally to the NFS shares: All cluster nodes need to have access to the SBD block devices

=== Parameter sheet

The cluster organizing two {saphana} 'swarms' is quite complex. The installation
should be planned properly. You should have all needed parameters like SID, IP
addresses and much more already in place. It is a good practice to first fill out
the parameter sheet and then begin with the installation.

=== Scale-out scenario and resource agents

To automate the failover, the High Availability Extension built into
_{sles4sap}_ is used. Two resource agents have been created to handle the scenario.

The first is the *SAPHanaController* resource agent (RA), which checks and
manages the {saphana} database instances. This RA is configured as a
master/slave resource.

The master assumes responsibility for the active master name server of the
{saphana} database running in primary mode. All other instances are
represented by the slave mode.

.Cluster resource agents and master/slave status mapping
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Cluster-Resources02.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

The second resource agent is *SAPHanaTopology*. This RA has been created to make configuring the cluster as simple as possible.
It runs on all nodes (beside the majority maker)
of a {sle} High Availability Extension 12 cluster. It gathers information about the statuses and
configurations of the {saphana} system replication. It is designed as a normal
(stateless) clone resource.

{SAPHANA} system replication for scale-out is supported in the following
scenarios or use cases:

Performance optimized, single container (A > B)::
This scenario and setup is described in this document. In the performance
optimized scenario an {saphana} RDBMS on site "A" is synchronizing with an
{saphana} RDBMS on a second site "B". As the {saphana} RDBMS on the second site
is configured to preload the tables the takeover time is typically very short.

////
TO BE ADDED LATER, AFTER WE WILL HOPEFULLY GET A SOLUTION FOR THAT
Cost optimized (A > B, Q)::
This scenario and setup is described in an other document in the resource
library ({reslibrary}) for on-premise systems. It can be adopted to Azure too.
In the cost optimized scenario the second node is also used for a non-productive
{saphana} RDBMS system (like QAS or TST). Whenever a takeover is needed the
non-productive system must be stopped first. As the productive secondary system
on this node must be limited in using system resources, the table preload must
be switched off and a possible takeover needs longer than in the performance
optimized use case.

Multi Tier (A > B > C)::
This scenario and setup is described in an other document in the resource
library ( {reslibrary} ) for on-premise systems. It can be adopted to Azure
too.. A Multi Tier system replication has an additional target, which must be
connected to the secondary (chain topology).
////

Performance optimized, multi-tenancy also named MDC (%A > %B)::
Multi-tenancy is supported for all of the above scenarios and use cases. This scenario
is supported since {SAPHANA} 1 SPS12. The setup and configuration from a cluster
point of view is the same for multi-tenancy and single containers. Thus you can use
the above documents for both types of scenarios.

Multi-tenancy is the default installation type for {SAPHANA} 2.0.

=== The concept of the Performance Optimized Scenario

In case of failure of the primary {saphana} on site 1 the cluster first tries to
start the takeover process. This allows to use the already loaded data at the
secondary site. Typically the takeover is much faster than the local restart.

A site is noticed as "down" or "on error", if the *LandscapeHostConfiguration
status* reflects this (return code 1). This happens when worker nodes are going
down without any {SAPHANA} standby nodes left. Standby nodes are designed to perform a host
auto-failover for the worker functionality.

Without any additional intervention the resource agent will wait for the {sap}
internal HA cluster to repair the situation locally. An additional intervention
could be a custom python hook using the SAP provider *srServiceStateChanged()*
available since {SAPHANA} 2.0 SPS01.

To achieve an automation of this resource handling process, use the
{SAPHANA} resource agents included in the _SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut_ RPM package delivered with
{sles4sap}.

You can configure the level of automation by setting the parameter
_AUTOMATED_REGISTER_. If automated registration is activated the cluster will
also automatically register a former failed primary to get the new secondary.

=== Important prerequisites

Read the SAP Notes and papers first.

The _SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut_ resource agent software package
supports scale-out (multiple-box to multiple-box) system replication with the
following configurations and parameters:

* The cluster must include a valid STONITH method.
* As the STONITH mechanism SBD is recommended.
* Both sites are either in the same network segment (layer 2) to allow an easy
  takeover of an IP Address, or you need a technique like overlay IP addresses in
  virtual private clouds.
* Technical users and groups, such as _{refsidadm}_ are defined *locally* in the
  Linux system.
* Name resolution of the cluster nodes and the virtual IP address should be done
  *locally* on *all* cluster nodes to not depend on DNS services (as it
  can fail, too).
* Time synchronization between the cluster nodes using reliable time services
  like NTP.
* Both {saphana} sites have the same SAP Identifier (SID) and instance number.
* The {SAPHANA} scale-out system must have only *one* active master name server per
  site. It should have up to three master name server candidates ({SAPHANA}
  nodes with a configured role 'master<N>').
* The {SAPHANA} scale-out system must have only *one* failover group.
* The cluster described in this document does not manage any service IP address
  for a read-enabled secondary site.
* There is only one {saphana} system replication like from site "A" to site "B" but no
  third site "C" (also called multi-tier or multi-target).
* The setup implements the performance optimized scenario but not the cost
  optimized scenario.
* The _{sapHostAgent}_ must be running. _{sapHostAgent}_ is needed to translate between
  the system node names and SAP host names used during the installation of {saphana}.
* The replication mode should be either 'sync' or 'syncmem'.
* All {saphana} instances controlled by the cluster must not be activated via
  _sapinit_ autostart.

[IMPORTANT]
====
Automated registration of a failed primary after takeover is possible. But as a
good starting configuration for projects, it is recommended to switch *off* the
automated registration of a failed primary, therefore the
`AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"` is the *default*.

In this case, you need to register a failed primary after a takeover manually.
Use SAP tools like {SAPHANA} Cockpit or *hdbnsutil*.
// DONE PRIO3: Should we add also hana cockpit here?
====

//* For optimal automation, _AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"_ is recommended.
* Automated start of {SAPHANA} instances during system boot must be switched
  *off*.
* You need at least SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut version 0.161, {sles4sap} 12 SP2 and
  {SAPHANA} 1.0 SPS12 (121) or {SAPHANA} 2.0 SPS 2 for all mentioned setups.

IMPORTANT: You must implement a valid STONITH method. Without a valid STONITH
method, the complete cluster is unsupported and will not work properly.

This setup-guide focuses on the performance optimized setup as it is the
only supported scenario at the point of writing this guide.

If you need to implement a different scenario, it is strongly recommended to define
a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) with {SUSE}. This PoC will focus on testing the existing
solution in your scenario. The limitation of most of the above items is mostly
due to testing limits.

== Setting up the operating system

[[OsSetup]]This section includes information you should consider during the
installation of the operating system.

.<<Planning>> OsSetup <<SAPHanaInst>> <<SAPHanaHsr>> <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase2.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]


In this document, first {sles4sap} is installed and configured. Then the {saphana}
database including the system replication is set up. Finally the
automation with the cluster is set up and configured.

// * SAP notes reference - each note mentioned here should also be added
//   to the appendix
// * ....


=== Installing {sles4sap}

Multiple installation guides are already existing, with different reasons to set up the server in a certain way.
Below it is outlined where this information can be found.
In addition, you will find important details you should consider to get a system which is well prepared to deliver {sapHana}.

==== Installing the base operating system

Depending on your infrastructure and the hardware used, you need to adapt the installation.
All supported installation methods and minimum requirement are described in the _Deployment Guide_
(https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/html/SLES-all/book-sle-deployment.html).
In case of automated installations you can find further information in the _AutoYaST Guide_
(https://documentation.suse.com/sles/12-SP5/html/SLES-all/book-autoyast.html).
The major installation guide for {sles4sap} to fit all requirements for {sapHana} is described in the
SAP notes:

// SUSE and SAP are kept literal here not by the reference, because its a quote of an external title
- 1984787 SUSE LINUX Enterprise Server 12: Installation notes and
- 2205917 SAP HANA DB: Recommended OS settings for SLES 12 / SLES for SAP applications 12.


==== Installing additional software
{SUSE} delivers with {sles4sap} special resource agents for {sapHana}. With the pattern _sap-hana_ the resource
agent for {sapHana} *ScaleUP* is installed. For the *ScaleOut* scenario you need a special resource agent.
Follow the instructions below on each node if you have installed the systems based on SAP note 1984787.
The pattern _High Availability_ summarizes all tools recommended to be installed on *all* nodes, including the
_majority maker_.

* remove package: patterns-sap-hana, {sapHanaSR}, yast2-sap-ha
* install package: {sapHanaSR}-ScaleOut, {sapHanaSR}-ScaleOut-doc
* install pattern: ha_sles

To do so, for example, use Zypper:

// SUSE is kept literal here, because it is a quote from a command output

==== Getting the latest updates
If you have installed the packages before, make sure to deploy the newest updates on *all* machines
to have the latest versions of the resource agents and other packages. A prerequisite is a valid
subscription for {sles4sap}. There are multiple ways to get updates via {SUSE} Manager, the
Subscription Management Tool (SMT), or via a direct connection to the {SUSE} Customer Center (SCC).

Depending on your company or customer rules, use `zypper update` or `zypper patch`.

.Software update must be triggered from each node
====
The command `zypper patch` will install all available needed patches.
As user root, type:

----
# zypper patch
----

The command `zypper update` will update all or specified installed packages with newer versions, if possible.
As user root, type:

----
# zypper update

=== Configuring {sles4sap} to run {sapHana}

==== Tuning or modifying

Operating system tuning are described in SAP note 1275776 and 2205917.
The SAP note 1275776 explains three ways to implementing the settings.

.Using saptune (preferred)
====
[subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
# saptune solution apply HANA
----
====

The SAP note 2205917 covers the following modifications:

- {sles} 12 GA (no SP) and {sles} 12 SP1 Linux kernel upgrade
- {sles} 12 SP2 Linux kernel upgrade
- {sles} 12 SP3 Linux kernel upgrade
- {sles} 12 SP4 Linux kernel upgrade
- Additional 3rd-party kernel modules
- Configure tuned to use profile "sap-hana" (applies to Intel-based systems only)
- Increase UserTasksMax
- Turn off NUMA balancing
- Disable transparent hugepages
- Configure C-States for lower latency in Linux (applies to Intel-based systems only)
- CPU Frequency/Voltage scaling (applies to Intel-based systems only)
- Energy Performance Bias (EPB, applies to Intel-based systems only)
- Turn off kernel samepage merging (KSM)
- IBM EnergyScale for POWER8 Processor-Based Systems (applies to IBM Power systems only)
- Linux page cache limit
- Network settings
- Intel Cluster-On-Die (COD) / sub-NUMA clustering technology

==== Enabling SSH access via public key (optional)
Public key authentication provides SSH users access to their servers without entering their passwords.
SSH keys are also more secure than passwords, because the private key used to secure the connection
is never shared. Private keys can also be encrypted. Their encrypted contents cannot easily be read.
For the document at hand, a very simple but useful setup is used. This setup is based on
only one ssh-key pair which enables SSH access to all cluster nodes.

NOTE: Follow your company security policy to set up access to the systems.

.SSH key creation and exchange
====
As user root create an SSH key on one node.

----
# ssh-keygen -t rsa
----

The ssh-key generation asks for missing parameters.

----
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:ip/8kdTbYZNuuEUAdsaYOAErkwnkAPBR7d2SQIpIZCU root@<host1>
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|XEooo+ooo+o      |
|=+.= o=.o+.      |
|..B o. + o.      |
|   o  . +... .   |
|        S.. *    |
|     . o . B o   |
|    . . o o =    |
|     o . . +     |
|      +.. .      |
+----[SHA256]-----+
----

After the `ssh-keygen` is set up, you will have two new files under `/root/.ssh/` .

----
# ls /root/.ssh/
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
----

To allow password-free access for the user root between nodes in the cluster copy `id_rsa.pub` to `authorized_keys` and set the required permissions.

----
# cp /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
----

Collect the public host keys from all other node. For the document at hand, the _ssh-keyscan_ command is used.

----
# ssh-keyscan
----

The SSH host key is automatically collected and stored in the file `/root/.ssh/known_host` during the first SSH
connection. To avoid to confirm the first login with "yes", which accepts the host key, collect and store
them beforehand.

----
# ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 <host1>,<host1 ip> >>.ssh/known_hosts
# ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 <host2>,<host2 ip> >>.ssh/known_hosts
# ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 <host3>,<host3 ip> >>.ssh/known_hosts
...
----

After collecting all host keys push the entire directory `/root/.ssh/` from the first node to all further cluster members.

----
# rsync -ay /root/.ssh/ <host2>:/root/.ssh/
# rsync -ay /root/.ssh/ <host3>:/root/.ssh/
# rsync -ay /root/.ssh/ <host4>:/root/.ssh/
...

==== Setting up disk layout for {sapHana}

An SAP certified storage system with a validated storage
API is generally recommended. This is a prerequisite of a stable and reliable scale-out installation.

- /hana/shared/{refSID}
- /hana/data/{refSID}
- /hana/log/{refSID}

// TODO PRIO3: (FH) Picture showing the nodes/swarms consuming the NFS pools and shares.

Create the mount directories on all {saphana} nodes.
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# mkdir -p /hana/shared/{refSID}
# mkdir -p /hana/data/{refSID}
# mkdir -p /hana/log/{refSID}
# mkdir -p /usr/sap
----

The {saphana} installation needs a special storage setup. The NFS setup used for this guide must be
reboot-persistent. You can achieve this with entries in the `/etc/fstab`.

NOTE: NFS version 4 is required in the setup at hand.

.Create permanent mount entries for all NFS pools
==========

Create _/etc/fstab_ entries for the three NFS pools.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
<nfs1>  /hana/data/{refSID}      nfs4  defaults  0 0
<nfs2>  /hana/shared/{refSID}    nfs4  defaults  0 0
<nfs3> /hana/log/{refSID}        nfs4  defaults  0 0
----

In the sample environment those lines are as follows:

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{myNFSSharedSite1}  /hana/data/{SID}      nfs4  defaults  0 0
{myNFSDataSite1}  /hana/shared/{SID}    nfs4  defaults  0 0
{myNFSLogSite1} /hana/log/{SID}        nfs4  defaults  0 0
----
==========

Mount all NFS shares.
----
# mount -a
----

Create other directories (optional).
----
# mkdir -p /sapsoftware
----

File systems

/hana/shared/{refSID}::
The mount directory is used for shared files between all hosts in an {SAPHANA}
system. This directory needs to be accessible to each of the servers in the
{SAPHANA} cluster.

/hana/log/{refSID}::
The default path to the log directory depends on the system ID of the {SAPHANA}
host.

/hana/data/{refSID}::
The default path to the data directory depends on the system ID of the {SAPHANA}
host.

/usr/sap::
This is the path to the local SAP system instance directories. It is possible
to join this location with the Linux installation.

/sapsoftware:: (optional)
Space for copying the SAP install software media. This NFS pool is mounted on both sites and contains
the {sapHana} installation media and installation parameter files.

Set up host name resolution for all machines.

You can either use a DNS server or modify the _/etc/hosts_ on *all* nodes.

With maintaining the `/etc/hosts` file, you minimize the impact of a failing
DNS service. Replace the IP address and the host name in the following commands.

[subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
vi /etc/hosts
----

Insert the following lines to `/etc/hosts`. Change the IP address and host name
to match your environment.

Enable NTP service on all nodes.

Simply enable an *ntp service* on all node in the cluster to have proper time
synchronization.

== Installing the {saphana} databases on both sites
[[SAPHanaInst]]The infrastructure is set up. Now install the {saphana} database on
both sites. In a cluster a machine is also called a _node_.

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> SAPHanaInst <<SAPHanaHsr>> <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase3.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

In the example at hand, to make it easier to follow the documentation, the
machines (or nodes) are named _{mySite1FirstNode}_, ... _suseXX_. The nodes with odd numbers
(suse01, suse03, suse05, ...) will be part of site "A" ({mySite1Name}) and the nodes with even numbers
(suse02, suse04, suse06, ...) will be part of site "B"({mySite2Name}) .

The following users are automatically created during the {saphana} installation:

{refsidadm}::
The user{refsidadm} is the operating system user required for administrative
tasks, such as starting and stopping the system.
sapadm::
The SAP Host Agent  administrator.
SYSTEM::
The {saphana} database superuser.

// TODO PRIO3: Add also groups?

=== Preparation
- Read the SAP Installation and Setup Manuals available at the SAP Marketplace.

- Download the {SAPHANA} Software from SAP Marketplace.

- Mount the file systems to install {SAPHANA} database software and database
  content (data and log).

=== Installation

. Mount /hana/shared from the nfs server.
+
[subs="specialchars,quotes,attributes"]
----
# for system in suse0{1,2,3,4,5,6}; do
    ssh $system mount -a
done
----
+
. Install the {saphana} Database as described in the {SAPHANA} Server
Installation Guide on *all* machines (two sites) except the majority maker.
Both databases need to have same SID and instance number.
You can use either the graphical user interface or the command line
installer _hdblcm_. The command line installer can be used in an interactive
or batch mode.
// TODO PRIO3: Use an answer file instead or provide it in the appendix
+
.Using hdblcm in interactive mode
==============================
----
# <path_to_sap_media>/hdblcm
----
==============================
+
Alternatively you can also use the batch mode of _hdblcm_. This can either be
done by specifying all needed parameters via the command line or by using a
parameter file.
+
In the example at hand the command line parameters are used. In the batch mode you
need to provide an XML password file (here <path>/hana_passwords). A template of this
password file can be created with the following command:
+

.Creating a password file
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# <path_to_sap_media>/hdblcm --dump_configfile_template=templateFile
----
==========
+
This command creates two files:
+
--
* _templateFile_ is the template for a parameter file.
* _templateFile.xml_ is the XML template used to provide several hana_passwords
to the hdblcm installer.
--
+

The XML password file looks as follows:
+

.The XML password template
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- Replace the 3 asterisks with the password -->
<Passwords>
    <root_password><![CDATA[***]]></root_password>

    <ase_user_password><![CDATA[***]]></ase_user_password>
    <org_manager_password><![CDATA[***]]></org_manager_password>
</Passwords>
----
==========
+

After having created the XML password file, you can immediately start the
{saphana} installation in batch mode by providing all needed parameters via
the command line.
+
.Using hdblcm in batch mode
==============================
// DONE PRIO2: (FH) Add text about hdblcm command line and password file
// explain hana_passwords
// maybe use a answering file
In the example below the password file is used to provide the password during the installation dialog.
All installation parameters are named directly as one command.

==============================

=== Checks

Verify that *both* database sites are up and all processes of these databases
are running correctly.

. As Linux user _{refsidadm}_ use the SAP command line tool _HDB_ to get an
overview of all running {saphana} processes. The output of _HDB info_ should look like
the example below for *both* sites:

== Setting up the {SAPHANA} system replication
[[SAPHanaHsr]]This section describes the setup of the system replication (HSR) after {saphana} has
been installed properly.

**Procedure**

. Back up the primary database
. Enable the primary database
. Register the secondary database
. Verify the system replication

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> SAPHanaHsr <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase4.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

For more information read the Section _Setting Up System Replication_ of the
{saphana} Administration Guide.

=== Backing up the primary database
First back up the primary database as described in the
_{saphana} Administration Guide, Section {saphana} Database Backup and Recovery_.

Below find examples to back up {saphana} with SQL Commands:

.Simple backup for the system database and all tenants with one single backup call
=========================
As user {refsidadm} enter the following command:

----
~> hdbsql -i {refInst} -u SYSTEM -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR FULL SYSTEM USING FILE ('backup')"
----

You get the following command output (or similar):

----
0 rows affected (overall time 15.352069 sec; server time 15.347745 sec)
----
=========================

.Simple backup for a single container (non-MDC) database
=========================
Enter the following command as user {refsidadm}:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbsql -i {refInst} -u <dbuser> \
   "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('backup')"
----
=========================

////
.Back up the system database only
=========================
----
~> hdbsql -i <inst> -u <dbuser> -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA ALL USING FILE ('<path>')"
----
=========================

.Back up a tenant using a systemdb database user
=========================
----
~> hdbsql -i <instnr> -u <dbuser> -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR <DBNAME> USING FILE ('<path>')"
----
=========================

.Back up the tenant using a tenant database user
=========================
----
~> hdbsql -i <instnr> -u <dbuser> -d <tenantDBNAME> \
   "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('<path>’)”
----

=========================
////

////
If you have (for example) created a backup database user and a user key
_hanabackup_, you can create an initial backup of an MDC {SAPHANA} using the
following command:

----
~> hdbsql -U hanabackup \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR FULL SYSTEM USING FILE ('backup')"
----
////

IMPORTANT: Without a valid backup, you *cannot* bring {SAPHANA} into a system
replication configuration.

// TODO PRIO3: (BS) Add section about separate SR network. Only a hint not a
//    complete setup

=== Enabling the primary database
As Linux user _{refsidadm}_ enable the system replication at the primary node. You
need to define a site name (like _{mySite1Name}_) which must be unique for all {SAPHANA}
databases which are connected via system replication. This means the secondary
must have a different site name.

.Enable the system replication on the primary site
==========
As user {refsidadm} enable the primary:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name={mySite1Name}
----

Check if the command output is similar to:
// DONE PRIO2: (all) Check if the following output is valid:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
nameserver is active, proceeding ...
successfully enabled system as system replication source site
done.
----
==========

The command line tool _hdbnsutil_ can be used to check the system replication
mode and site name.

.Check the system replication configuration status as user {refsidadm} on the primary
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration
----

If the system replication enablement was successful at the primary, the
output should be as follows:
// DONE PRIO2: (all) Check if the following output is valid:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
checking for active or inactive nameserver ...
System Replication State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mode: primary
site id: 1
site name: {mySite1Name}
done.
----
==========

The mode has changed from “none” to “primary” and the site now has a site name
and a site ID.

=== Registering the secondary database
The {saphana} database instance on the secondary side must be stopped before the
system can be registered for the system replication. You can use your
preferred method to stop the instance (like _HDB_ or _sapcontrol_). After the
database instance has been stopped successfully, you can register the instance
using _hdbnsutil_.

.Stop the secondary as Linux user _{refsidadm}_:
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> sapcontrol -nr {refInst} -function StopSystem
----
==========

// TODO PRIO3: Any need to adapt the following files to be "neutral" and not
// bound to a specific site or hostname? We need at least to change files for
// the XSA (see SAP Note xxxx)
// The files are in binary format but include the name 'suse01' (of the primary)

.Copy the KEY and KEY-DATA file from the primary to the secondary site
==========
The copy of key and key-data should only be done on the master name server.
As the files are in the global file space, you do not need to run the command
on all cluster nodes.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
cd /usr/sap/{refSID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs
rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/data/SSFS_{refSID}.DAT
rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/key/SSFS_{refSID}.KEY
----
==========

// rsync -va {,suse02:}/usr/sap/HA1/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/data/SSFS_HA1.DAT
// rsync -va {,suse02:}/usr/sap/HA1/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/key/SSFS_HA1.KEY

.Register the secondary as Linux user _{refsidadm}_:
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_register --name=<site2> \
     --remoteHost=<node1-siteA> --remoteInstance={refInst} \
     --replicationMode=sync --operationMode=logreplay
----

// DONE PRIO2: (all) Check if the following output is valid:
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
adding site ...
checking for inactive nameserver ...
nameserver {mySite2FirstNode}:30001 not responding.
collecting information ...
updating local ini files ...
done.
----
==========

The _remoteHost_ is the primary node in our case, the _remoteInstance_ is the
database instance number (here {myHANAInst}).

Now start the database instance again and verify the system replication status.
On the secondary site, the mode should be one of „SYNC“, „SYNCMEM“ or „ASYNC“.
The mode depends on the *sync* option defined during the registration of the
secondary.

.Start the system on the secondary site as user {refsidadm}
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> sapcontrol -nr {refInst} -function StartSystem
----

Wait until the {sapHana} database is started completely.
==========

.Check the system replication configuration as Linux user {refsidadm}
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration
----

The output should look like the following:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
System Replication State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mode: sync
site id: 2
site name: {mySite2Name}
active primary site: 1

primary masters: {suse01} {suse03} {suse05}
done.
----
==========


=== Verifying the system replication

To view the replication state of the whole {saphana} cluster, use the following
command as _{refsidadm}_ user on the primary site.

.Check the system replication status at the primary site (as {refsidadm})
=========
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py
----

This script prints a human-readable table of the system replication channels and their status. The
most interesting column is the **Replication Status**, which should be **ACTIVE**.

== Integrating {sapHana} with the cluster

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> <<SAPHanaHsr>> Integration <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase5.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

[[Integration]]Proceed with the following steps:

**Procedure**

. Implement the python hook SAPHanaSR
. Configure system replication operation mode
. Allow {refsidadm} to access the cluster
. Start {saphana}
. Test the hook integration

=== Implementing the Python hook SAPHanaSR

This step must be done on both sites. The hook must be available on all {saphana} nodes.
{SAPHANA} must be stopped to change the
_global.ini_ and allow {SAPHANA} to integrate the HA/DR hook script during start.
Use the hook script SAPHanaSR.py from the SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut package.
See manual pages SAPHanaSR.py(7) and SAPHanaSR-manageProvider(8) for details.

- Install the HA/DR hook script into a read/writable directory
- Integrate the hook into _global.ini_ ({saphana} needs to be stopped for doing that offline)
- Check integration of the hook during start-up

NOTE: All hook scripts should be used directly from the SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut package.
If the scripts are moved or copied, regular {SUSE} package updates will not work.

Stop {SAPHANA}.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> sapcontrol -nr {refInst} -function StopSystem
----

.Adding SAPHanaSR via global.ini
===================================
----
[ha_dr_provider_SAPHanaSR]
provider = SAPHanaSR
path = /usr/share/SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut
execution_order = 1

[trace]
ha_dr_saphanasr = info
----
===================================

=== Configuring the system replication operation mode

When your system is connected as an {sapHanaSR} target, you can find an entry in the _global.ini_ file
which defines the operation mode. Up to now there are two modes available:

* _delta_datashipping_
* _logreplay_

Until performing a takeover and re-registration in the opposite direction, the entry for the operation mode is missing on
your primary site. The "classic" operation mode is _delta_datashipping_. The preferred mode for HA is
_logreplay_. Using the operation mode _logreplay_ makes your secondary site in the {saphana}
system replication a hot standby system.
For more details regarding both modes check the SAP documentation such as the
SAP HANA System Replication guide (see https://help.sap.com/docs/SAP_HANA_PLATFORM/4e9b18c116aa42fc84c7dbfd02111aba/afac7100bc6d47729ae8eae32da5fdec.html).

Check both _global.ini_ files and add the operation mode, if needed.

section:: [ system_replication ]
key:: operation_mode = logreplay

Path for the _global.ini_: /hana/shared/<SID>/global/hdb/custom/config/
----
[system_replication]
operation_mode = logreplay
----

=== Allowing {refsidadm} to access the cluster

The current version of the SAPHanaSR python hook uses the command _sudo_ to allow
the {refsidadm} user to access the cluster attributes. In Linux you can use _visudo_
to start the vi editor for the */etc/sudoers* configuration file.

The user {refsidadm} must be able to set the cluster attribute hana_{refsidLC}_glob_srHook.
The {SAPHANA} system replication hook needs password free access. The following
example limits the sudo access to exactly setting the needed attribute.
See manual page sudoers(5) for details.

Replace the {refsidLC} by the lowercase SAP system ID.

.Entry in sudo permissions /etc/sudoers file
===================================
Basic parameter option to allow <sidadm> to use the srHook.

----

More specific parameters option to meet a high security level.
All Cmnd_Alias entries must be each defined as a single line entry.
In the following example the lines might include a line-break forced by document
formatting.
The alias identifier needs to be in capitals.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----

Cmnd_Alias SFAIL = /usr/sbin/crm_attribute -n hana_{refsidLC}_glob_srHook -v SFAIL -t crm_config -s SAPHanaSR
{refsidadm} ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: SOK, SFAIL

=== Starting {saphana}

After having completed the {saphana} integration and having configured the communication between
{saphana} and the cluster, you can start the {saphana} databases on both sites.

. Final steps

=== Installing the cluster packages

If not already done, install the pattern _High Availability_ on *all* nodes.

To do so, use Zypper.
----
# zypper in -t pattern ha_sles
----

Now the Resource Agents for controlling the {saphana} system replication need
to be installed at *all* cluster nodes, including the majority maker.
----
# zypper in SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut
----

If you have the packages installed before, make sure to get the newest updates
on *all* nodes
----
zypper patch
----

=== Configuring the basic cluster

// DONE PRIO1: (FH) Text (basic cluster configuration)

After having installed the cluster packages, the next step is to set up the basic cluster framework. For convenience, use
YaST or the _ha-cluster-init_ script.

[IMPORTANT]
It is strongly recommended to add a second corosync ring, implement unicast (UCAST)
communication and adjust the timeout values to your environment.

**Prerequisites**

* Name resolution
* Time synchronization
* Redundant network for cluster intercommunication
* STONITH method

==== Setting up watchdog for "Storage-based Fencing"
It is recommended to use Storage-based Fencing (SBD) as central STONITH device, as done in the example at hand. Each node constantly monitors
connectivity to the storage device, and terminates itself in case the partition becomes unreachable.
Whenever SBD is used, a
correctly working watchdog is crucial. Modern systems support a hardware watchdog that needs to
be "tickled" or "fed" by a software component. The software component (usually a daemon) regularly
writes a service pulse to the watchdog. If the daemon stops feeding the watchdog, the hardware will
enforce a system restart. This protects against failures of the SBD process itself, such as dying, or
getting stuck on an I/O error.

.Set up for Watchdog
====
IMPORTANT: Access to the watchdog timer:
No other software must access the watchdog timer. Some hardware vendors ship systems management
software that uses the watchdog for system resets (for example, HP ASR daemon). Disable such
software, if watchdog is used by SBD.

Determine the right watchdog module. Alternatively, you can find a list of installed drivers with your
kernel version.

----
# ls -l /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/watchdog
----

Check if any watchdog module is already loaded.

----
# lsmod | egrep "(wd|dog|i6|iT|ibm)"
----

If you get a result, the system has already a loaded watchdog. If the watchdog does not match
your watchdog device, you need to unload the module.

To safely unload the module, check first if an application is using the watchdog device.

----
# lsof /dev/watchdog
# rmmod <wrong_module>
----

Enable your watchdog module and make it persistent. For the example below, _softdog_ has been used which has some
restrictions and should not be used as first option.

----
# echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
# systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
----

Check if the watchdog module is loaded correctly.

----
# lsmod | grep dog
----

Testing the watchdog can be done with a simple action. Ensure to switch of your {sapHana}
first because watchdog will force an unclean reset / shutdown of your system.

In case of a hardware watchdog a desired action is predefined after the timeout of the watchdog has
reached. If your watchdog module is loaded and not controlled by any other application, do the following:

IMPORTANT: Triggering the watchdog without continuously updating the watchdog resets/switches off the system.
      This is the intended mechanism. The following commands will force your system to be reset/switched off.

----
# touch /dev/watchdog
----

In case the softdog module is used the following action can be performed:

----
# echo 1> /dev/watchdog
----

After your test was successful you can implement the watchdog on all cluster members. The example below
applies to the softdog module. Replace **<wrong_module>** by the module name queried before.

----
# for i in suse{02,03,04,05,06,-mm}; do
    ssh -T $i <<EOSSH
        hostname
        rmmod <wrong_module>
        echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
        systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
        lsmod |grep -e dog
EOSSH
done

// DONE PRIO2: check unicast
==== Setting up the initial cluster using _ha-cluster-init_
For more detailed information about ha-cluster-* tools, see section _Overview of the Bootstrap Scripts_ of the Installation and Setup Quick Start Guide
for SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension at https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/12-SP5/html/SLE-HA-all/art-ha-install-quick.html#sec-ha-inst-quick-bootstrap.
// DONE PRIO2: (FH) link missing ↑{sleha}.

// DONE PRIO2: Describe the procedure with option "-u" for creating a unicast config

Create an initial setup by using _ha-cluster-init_ command. Follow the dialog
steps.

NOTE: This is *only* to be done on the *first* cluster node. If you are using
SBD as STONITH mechanism, you need to first load the watchdog kernel module
matching your setup. In the example at hand the _softdog_ kernel module is used.


The command _ha_cluster-init_ configures the basic cluster framework including:

* SSH keys
* csync2 to transfer configuration files
* SBD (at least one device)
* corosync (at least one ring)
* HAWK Web interface

// DONE PRIO2: describe the init with option -u?


[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# ha-cluster-init -u -s <sbd-device>
----

As requested by _ha-cluster-init_, change the password of the user _hacluster_ on all cluster nodes.

NOTE: Do not forget to change the password of the user _hacluster_.

==== Configuring the cluster for all other cluster nodes
The other nodes of the cluster could be integrated by starting the
command _ha-cluster-join_. This command asks for the IP address or name of
the *first* cluster node. Then all needed configuration files are copied over.
As a result the cluster is started on *all* nodes. Do not forget the majority maker.

If you are using SBD as STONITH method, you need to activate the _softdog_ kernel
module matching your systems. In the example at hand the _softdog_ kernel module is used.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# ha-cluster-join -c {refHost1}
----

==== Checking the cluster for the first time
Now it is time to check and optionally start the cluster for the first time on
all nodes.

NOTE: All nodes should be started in parallel. Otherwise unseen nodes might get fenced.

Check the cluster status with `crm_mon`. Use the option `-r` to also see
resources which are configured but stopped.
----
# crm_mon -r
----

The command will show the "empty" cluster and will print something like the
screen output below. The most interesting information in this output is that
there are seven nodes in the status "online" and the message "partition with quorum".

=== Configuring cluster properties and resources
This section describes how to configure bootstrap, STONITH, resources, and constraints
using the _crm_ configure shell command as described in section
_Configuring and Managing Cluster Resources (Command Line)_ of the
{sleha} Administration Guide (see https://documentation.suse.com/en-us/sle-ha/12-SP5/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-manual-config.html).

Use the command _crm_ to add the objects to the Cluster Resource Management
(CRM). Copy the following examples to a local file and then load the
configuration to the Cluster Information Base (CIB). The benefit is that
you have a scripted setup and a backup of your configuration.

Perform all _crm_ commands only on *one* node, for example on machine {mySite1FirstNode}.

First write a text file with the configuration, which you load into your cluster
in a second step. This step is as follows:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# vi crm-file<XX>
# crm configure load update crm-file<XX>
----

==== Cluster bootstrap and more
The first example defines the cluster bootstrap options including the resource and
operation defaults.

// DONE PRIO2: check for azure
The `stonith-timeout` should be greater than 1.2 times the SBD `msgwait` timeout.
Find more details and examples in manual page SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut_basic_cluster(7).

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# vi crm-bs.txt
----

Enter the following to _crm-bs.txt_:

// NOTE: DONE PRIO1: - check the validity of the configuration (boot-strap)

----
property $id="cib-bootstrap-options" \
              no-quorum-policy="freeze" \
              stonith-enabled="true" \
              concurrent-fencing="true" \

              migration-threshold="50"
op_defaults $id="op-options" \
              timeout="600"
----

Now add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
crm configure load update crm-bs.txt
----

==== STONITH

As already explained in the requirements, STONITH is crucial for a supported cluster setup.
Without a valid fencing mechanism your cluster is unsupported.

A standard STONITH mechanism implements SBD based fencing. The SBD STONITH method is
very stable and reliable and has proved very good road capability.

You can use other fencing methods available for example from your public cloud provider.
However, it is crucial to intensively test the server fencing.

For SBD based fencing you can use one up to three SBD devices. The cluster will react differently
when an SBD device is lost. The differences and SBD fencing are explained very well in the {SUSE}
product documentation of the {sleha} Extension available at {productdocu}.

You need to adapt the SBD resource for the {saphana} scale-out cluster.

As user {refsidadm} create a file named for crm-fencing.txt.

==== Cluster in maintenance mode

Load the configuration for the resources and the constraints
step-by-step to the cluster to explain the different parts. The
best way to avoid unexpected cluster reactions is to

* first set the complete cluster to maintenance mode,
* then do all needed changes and,
* as last step, end the cluster maintenance mode.

// DONE PRIO2: Text about that step (descriptiddve and explain why)

----
# crm configure property maintenance-mode=true
----

==== SAPHanaTopology
Next, define the group of resources needed, before the {saphana} instances can be
started. Prepare the changes in a text file, for example _crm-saphanatop.txt_,
and load these with the _crm_ command.

If necessary, change the *SID* and *instance number* (bold) to appropriate
values for your setup.

The most important parameters here are _SID_ ({SID}) and _InstanceNumber_ ({Inst}),
which are self explaining in an SAP context.

Beside these parameters, the timeout values or the operations (start, monitor,
stop) are typical values to be adjusted for your environment.

==== SAPHanaController
Next, define the group of resources needed, before the {saphana} instances can be
started. Edit the changes in a text file, for example `crm-saphanacon.txt` and

.Table Description of important Resource Agent parameter
|===
|Name
|Description

|PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER
|Defines whether RA should prefer to takeover to the secondary instance instead
of restarting the failed primary locally. Set to *true* for SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut.

|AUTOMATED_REGISTER
|Defines whether a former primary should be automatically registered to be
secondary of the new primary. Defaults to *false*.

If set to *false*, the former primary must be manually registered. The cluster
will not start this {SAPHANA} RDBMS until it is registered to avoid double
primary up situations.

|DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT
|Time difference needed between two primary time stamps if a dual-primary
situation occurs. If the time difference is less than the time gap, the
cluster holds one or both sites in a "WAITING" status.
This is to give an administrator the chance to react on a failover. If the complete node
of the former primary crashed, the former primary will be registered after the
time difference is passed. If "only" the {SAPHANA} RDBMS has crashed, then the
former primary will be registered immediately. After this registration to the
new primary, all data will be overwritten by the system replication.

Additional information about all parameters can be found with the command
`man ocf_suse_SAPHanaController`.

==== The virtual IP address

=== Final Steps

==== Verifying the communication between the hook and the cluster

Now check if the HA/DR provider could set the appropriate
cluster attribute hana_{refsidLC}_glob_srHook:

.Query the srHook cluster attribute

// DONE PRIO2: (FH) This must stay here, because crm_attribute first needs the cluster setup :)

----
==========

In this case the HA/DR provider sets the attribute to SFAIL to inform the
cluster about a broken system replication.

==== Using special virtual host names or FQHN during the installation of {saphana}

If you have used special virtual host names or the fully qualified host name
(FQHN) instead of the short node name, the resource agents need to map these
names. To be able to match the short node name with the used SAP 'virtual
host name', the {sapHostAgent} needs to report the list of installed instances
correctly:

== Testing the cluster
// DONE PRIO2: (all) Improve the wording and add some more tests

[[Testing]]Testing is one of the most important project tasks for implementing clusters.
Proper testing is crucial. Make sure that all test cases
derived from project or customer expectations are defined and passed completely.
*Without testing the project is likely to fail in production use*.

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> <<SAPHanaHsr>> <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> Testing
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase7.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

The test prerequisite, if not described differently, is always that all cluster
nodes are booted, are already normal members of the cluster and the {saphana} RDBMS
is running. The system replication is in state *SYNC* represented by 'SOK'.
The cluster is idle, no actions are pending, no migration constraints left over, no failcounts left over.

In the current version of this setup guide a plain list of test cases is provided. A more detailed description of the
test cases is planned for future versions. These details will be provided either in an updated version of this guide
or the test cases will be extracted to a separate test plan document.

=== Generic cluster tests

The cluster tests described in this section cover the cluster reaction during operations. This includes starting and stopping
the complete cluster or simulating SBD failures and much more.

* Parallel start of all cluster nodes (`systemctl start pacemaker` should be done in a short time frame).
* Stop of the complete cluster.
* Isolate ONE of the two {saphana} sites.
* Power-off the majority maker.
* Isolate the SBD.
* Simulate a maintenance procedure with cluster continuously running.
* Simulate a maintenance procedure with cluster restart.
// * ? Force a sr_takeover via cluster migration commands (use force!!).
* Kill the corosync process of one of the cluster nodes.

=== Tests on the primary site

The tests described in this section are checking the reaction on several failures of the primary site.

==== Tests regarding cluster nodes of the primary site

The tests listed here check the {saphana} and cluster reaction if one or more nodes of the primary site are failing or
re-joining the cluster.

* Power-off master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any standby node of the primary.
* Re-join of a previously power-off cluster node.

==== Tests regarding the complete primary site

This test category is simulating a complete site failure.

* Power-off all nodes of the primary site in parallel.

==== Tests regarding the {saphana} instances of the primary site

The tests listed here are checks about the {saphana} and cluster reactions triggered by application failures such as a crashed {saphana} instance.

* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any standby node.
* Kill sapstartsrv of any {saphana} instance of the primary.

=== Tests on the secondary site

The tests described in this section are checking the reaction on several failures of the secondary site.

==== Tests regarding cluster nodes of the secondary site

The tests listed here check the {saphana} and cluster reaction if one or more nodes of the secondary site are failing or
re-joining the cluster.

* Power-off master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any standby node of the secondary.
* Re-join of a previously power-off cluster node.

==== Tests regarding the complete secondary site

This test category is simulating a complete site failure.

* Power-off all nodes of the secondary site in parallel.

==== Tests regarding the {saphana} instances of the secondary site

The tests listed here are checks about the {saphana} and cluster reactions triggered by application failures such as a crashed {saphana} instance.

* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any standby node.
* Kill _sapstartsrv_ of any {saphana} instance of the secondary.

== Administration
=== Dos and don'ts

In your project, you should *do* the following:

* Define (and test) STONITH *before* adding other resources to the cluster.

* Do *intensive* testing.

* *Tune* the timeouts of operations of SAPHanaController and SAPHanaTopology.

* Start with ** PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER=true**, **AUTOMATED_REGISTER=false** and
  **DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT=”7200”**.

* Always make sure that the cluster configuration does not contain any left-over
  client-prefer location constraints or failcounts.

* Before testing or beginning maintenance procedures, check if the cluster is
  in idle state.

In your project, *avoid* the following:

* Rapidly changing/changing back cluster configuration, such as: Setting nodes
  to standby and online again or stopping/starting the master/slave resource.

* Creating a cluster without proper time synchronization or unstable name
  resolutions for hosts, users, and groups.

* Adding location rules for the clone, master/slave or IP resource. Only
  location rules mentioned in this setup guide are allowed.

* As "migrating" or "moving" resources in _crm-shell_, HAWK or other tools would
  add client-prefer location rules, these activities are completely *forbidden!*.

=== Monitoring and tools
You can use the High Availability Web Konsole (HAWK), {saphana} Studio and
different command line tools for cluster status requests.

==== HAWK – cluster status and more
You can use an Internet browser to check the cluster status. Use the following URL:
\https://<node>:7630

////
TODO PRIO3: Discuss some disadvantages of HAWK or missing features:
S_IDLE? cs_cluterstate or crm_simulate
cli-? crm configure | grep cli
failcount? -INF?
////

The login credentials are provided during the installation dialog of _ha-cluster-init_. Keep in mind to
change the default password of the Linux user _hacluster_ .

.Cluster Status in Hawk
image::cluster_status_hawk_1.png[scaledwidth="95%"]

If you set up the cluster using _ha-cluster-init_ and you have installed all
packages as described above, your system will provide a very useful Web
interface. You can use this graphical Web interface to get an overview of the
complete cluster status, perform administrative tasks or even configure resources
and cluster bootstrap parameters.

Read the product manuals for a complete documentation of this powerful user
interface.

==== {SAPHANA} Studio
Database-specific administration and checks can be done with {SAPHANA} Cockpit.

// DONE PRIO1: (FH) picture studio landscape scale-out

.{SAPHANA} Studio – Landscape of a scale-out system
image::hana_studio_landscape.png[scaledwidth="95%"]

NOTE: Be extremely careful with changing any parameter or the topology of the
system replication. This might cause an interference with the cluster resource management.

A positive example is to register a former primary as new secondary and you have
set _AUTOMATED_REGISTER=false_.

A negative example is to un-register a secondary,
disable the system replication on the primary, and similar actions.

For all actions that change the system replication it is recommended to first check
for the maintenance procedure.

==== Cluster command line tools

crm_mon::
A simple overview can be obtained by calling _crm_mon_. Using the option _-r_ shows
also stopped but already configured resources. Option _-1_ tells _crm_mon_ to
output the status once instead of periodically.

See the manual page _crm_mon(8)_ for details.

SAPHanaSR-showAttr::
To show some SAPHanaController and SAPHanaTopology resource agent
internal values, you can call the program _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_. The internal
values, storage location and their parameter names may change in the next versions.
The command _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ will always fetch the values from the correct
storage location.

[IMPORTANT]
Do *not* use cluster commands like _crm_attribute_ to fetch the values directly
from the cluster. Your methods will be broken, when you
need to move an attribute to a different storage location or even out of the cluster.
_SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ is firstly a test program only and should not be used for
automated system monitoring.

The tool displays all interesting cluster attributes in three areas.

* The **global** section includes the information about the cib time stamp and
  the attributes covering the status of the system replication

* The **site** section includes the attributes per site and shows which site is
  the primary and the return code of the _landscapeHostConfiguration.py_
  script. In addition the active master name server is shown per site.

* The **hosts** section includes the node status, the roles of the host inside the
  {saphana} database, the calculated score to get the primary master name server and
  the site name the host belongs to.

The majority maker _suse-mm_ does not run an {saphana} instance and therefore
neither has a role attribute nor a score or site value.

==== {SAPHANA} LandscapeHostConfiguration

To check the status of an {SAPHANA} database and to figure out if the cluster
should react, you can use the script `landscapeHostConfiguration.py`.

Following the SAP HA guideline, the _SAPHana_ resource agent interprets the
return codes in the following way:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
.Table Interpretation of Return Codes
|===
|Return Code
|Description

|4
|{SAPHANA} database is up and OK. The cluster does interpret this as correctly
running database.

|3
|{SAPHANA} database is up and in status INFO. The cluster does interpret this as
a correctly running database.

|2
|{SAPHANA} database is up and in status warning. The cluster does interpret this
as a correctly running database.

|1
|{SAPHANA} database is down. If the database should be up and is not own by
intention, this could trigger a takeover.

|0
|Internal Script Error – to be ignored.
