= Hardware Monitoring for SAP Systems


[[sec-introduction]]
== Introduction

Many customers deploy SAP systems such as SAP S/4HANA for their global operations, to support mission-critical business functions. This means the need for maximized system availability becomes crucial. 
Accordingly, IT departments are faced with very demanding SLAs: many companies now require 24x7 reliability for their SAP systems.

The base for every SAP system is a solid infrastructure supporting it. 

Operating System:: {sles4sap} is the leading Linux platform for SAP HANA, SAP NetWeaver and SAP S/4HANA solutions. 
It helps reduce downtime with the flexibility to configure and deploy a choice of multiple HA/DR scenarios for SAP HANA and NetWeaver-based applications.
System data monitoring enables proactive problem avoidance.

Hardware:: Most modern hardware platforms running SAP systems rely on Intel's system architecture. The combination of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server on the latest generation Intel Xeon Scalable processors and Intel Optane DC persistent memory help deliver fast, innovative, and secure IT services and to provide resilient enterprise S/4HANA platforms.

The Intel platform allows to monitor deep into the hardware, to gain insights in what the system is doing on a hardware level. Monitoring on a hardware level can help reduce downtime for SAP systems in several ways:

Failure prediction:: Identifying any hardware failure in advance allows customers to react early and in an scheduled manner, reducing the risk of errors that usually occur on operations executed during system outages. 

Failure remediation:: Having hardware metrics at hand when looking for the root cause of an issue, can help speed up the analysis and therefore reduce the time until the system(s) return to an operational state.
It can also reduce the reaction time, providing more precise information about problems, especially for big customers that usually have operations outsourced to many service providers and does not control the environment directly.

This paper describes a hardware monitoring solution for SAP systems, that allows to use hardware metrics provided by the Intel hardware platform to be analyzed in an SAP context.


[[sec-overview]]
== Hardware monitoring for SAP systems overview

The solution presented in this document consists of several open source tools, that are combined to collect logs and metrics from server systems, store them in a queriable database, and present them in a visual and easy-to-consume way.
In the following sections, we will give an overview of the components and how they work together.


=== Components

The monitoring solution proposed in this document consists of several components. 

.Hardware Monitoring Components
image::sap-infra-monitoring-hwmonitoring_components.png[Hardware Monitoring Components,scaledwidth=100%]

These components can be categorized by their use: 

Data Sources:: Components that simplify the collection of monitoring data, providing measurements or collected data in a way that the data storage components can pick them up.
Data Storage:: Components that store the data coming from the data sources, and provide a mechanism to query the data.
Data Visualization:: Components that allow a visual representation of the data stored in the data storage components, to make the (possibly aggregated) data easy to understand and analyze.

The following sections describe these components.


==== Data sources

The data source components collect data from OS or hardware interfaces, and provide them to the data storage layer.


===== Processor Counter Monitor (PCM)

https://github.com/opcm/pcm[Processor Counter Monitor (PCM)] is an application programming interface (API) and a set of tools based on the API to monitor performance and energy metrics of Intel{reg} Core{tm}, Xeon{reg}, Atom{tm} and Xeon Phi{tm} processors. 
PCM works on Linux, Windows, macOS X, FreeBSD and DragonFlyBSD operating systems.


===== `collectd` - system information collection daemon
https://collectd.org/[Collectd] is a small daemon which collects system information periodically and provides mechanisms to store and monitor the values in a variety of ways.


===== Prometheus node exporter 
The https://github.com/prometheus/node_exporter[Prometheus Node exporter] is an exporter for hardware and OS metrics exposed by *NIX kernels.
It is written in Go with pluggable metric collectors.


===== Prometheus IPMI exporter
The https://github.com/prometheus-community/ipmi_exporter[Prometheus IPMI Exporter] supports both

* the regular /metrics endpoint for Prometheus, exposing metrics from the host that the exporter is running on, 
* and an /ipmi endpoint that supports IPMI over RMCP.

One exporter instance running on one host can be used to monitor a large number of IPMI interfaces by passing the target parameter to a scrape.

CPU, Memory, Temperature, Disk
////


===== Promtail

https://grafana.com/docs/loki/latest/clients/promtail/[Promtail] is a Loki agent responsible for shipping the contents of local logs to a Loki instance. 
It is usually deployed to every machine that needed to be monitored.


==== Data collection

On the data collection layer, we use two tools, covering different kinds of data: metrics and logs.


===== Prometheus
https://prometheus.io[Prometheus] is an open source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit. 
It is storing time series data like metrics locally and runs rules over this data to aggregate and record new time series from existing data. Prometheus it also able to generate alerts.
The project has a very active developer and user community. 
It is now a stand-alone open source project and maintained independently of any company. 
This makes it very attractive for us as open source company and fits into our culture. 
To emphasize this, and to clarify the project's governance structure, Prometheus joined the Cloud Native Computing Foundation 5 years ago (2016).
Prometheus works well for recording any purely numeric time series.

Prometheus is designed for reliability, to be the system you go to during an outage to allow you to quickly analyze situations. 
Each Prometheus server is stand-alone, not depending on network storage or other remote services. 
You can rely on it when other parts of your infrastructure are broken, and you do not need to set up extensive infrastructure to use it.


===== Loki

https://grafana.com/oss/loki/[Loki] is a log aggregation system, inspired by Prometheus and designed to be a very cost effective and easy to operate.
Unlike other logging systems, Loki is built around the idea of only indexing a set of metadata (labels) for logs and leaving the original log message unindexed. 
Log data itself is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores, for example locally on the file system. 
A small index and highly compressed chunks simplify the operation and significantly lower the cost of Loki.


==== Data visualization

With the wealth of data collected in the previous steps, tooling is needed to make the data accessible. 
Through aggregation and visualization data becomes meaningful and consumable information. 


===== Grafana

https://grafana.com/oss/grafana/[Grafana] is an open source visualization and analytics platform.
Grafana's plug-in architecture allows interaction with a variety of data sources without creating data copies.
Its graphical browser-based user interface visualizes the data through highly customizable views, providing an interactive diagnostic workspace.  

Grafana can display metrics data from Prometheus and log data from Loki side-by-side, correlating events from log files with metrics. 
This can provide helpful insights when trying to identify the cause for an issue.
Also Grafana can trigger alerts based on metrics or log entries, and thus help identify potential issues early.

== Implementing hardware monitoring for SAP systems

The following sections show how to set up a monitoring solution based on the tools that have been discussed introduced in the solution overview.


=== Node exporter

The prometheus-node_exporter can be installed directly from the SUSE repository. 
It is part of {sles} and all derived products.

[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
----
zypper -n in golang-github-prometheus-node_exporter
----

Start and enable the node_exporter for automatic start at system boot.

[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
----
systemctl enable --now prometheus-node_exporter
----

[TIP]
====
To check if the exporter is running, you can use the following commands:
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
----
systemctl status prometheus-node_exporter
ss -tulpan |grep exporter
----
====

Configure the `node_exporter` depending on your needs. Arguments to be passed to `node_exporter` can be provided in the configuration file `/etc/sysconfig/prometheus-node_exporter`, for example to modify which metrics the `node_exporter` will collect and expose.

[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
.Arguments provided in /etc/sysconfig/prometheus-node_exporter
----
...
ARGS="--collector.systemd --no-collector.mdadm --collector.ksmd --no-collector.rapl --collector.meminfo_numa --no-collector.zfs --no-collector.udp_queues --no-collector.softnet --no-collector.sockstat --no-collector.nfsd --no-collector.netdev --no-collector.infiniband --no-collector.arp"
...
----
By default, the node_exporter is listening for incoming connections on port 9100.


=== `collectd`

The collectd packages can be installed from SUSE repositories as well. In this case we have used a newer version from the openSUSE repository.

Create a file `/etc/zypp/repos.d/server_monitoring.repo` and add the following content to it:
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
.Content for /etc/zypp/repos.d/server_monitoring.repo
----
[server_monitoring]
name=Server Monitoring Software (SLE_15_SP3)
type=rpm-md
baseurl=https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/monitoring/SLE_15_SP3/
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/server:/monitoring/SLE_15_SP3/repodata/repomd.xml.key
enabled=1
----

Afterward refresh the repository metadata and install `collectd` and its plugins.

[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
----
zypper ref
zypper in collectd collectd-plugins-all
----

Now the `collectd` must be adapted to collect the information we want and export it as we want to have them.
For example, when looking for network latency, we use the ping plugin and expose the data in a Prometheus format.

[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
.Configuration of collectd in /etc/collectd.conf (excerpts)
----
...
LoadPlugin ping
...
<Plugin ping>
        Host "10.162.63.254"
        Interval 1.0
        Timeout 0.9
        TTL 255
#       SourceAddress "1.2.3.4"
#       AddressFamily "any"
        Device "eth0"
        MaxMissed -1
</Plugin>
...
LoadPlugin write_prometheus
...
<Plugin write_prometheus>
        Port "9103"
</Plugin>
...
----

Uncomment the `LoadPlugin` line and check the `<Plugin ping>` section in the file.

Modify the `systemd` unit that `collectd` works as expected. First, create a copy from the system-provided service file.
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
----
cp /usr/lib/systemd/system/collectd.service /etc/systemd/system/collectd.service
----

Second, adapt this local copy.
Add the required `CapabilityBoundingSet` parameters in our local copy `/etc/systemd/system/collectd.service`.
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
----
...
# Here's a (incomplete) list of the plugins known capability requirements:
#   ping            CAP_NET_RAW
CapabilityBoundingSet=CAP_NET_RAW
...
----

Activate the changes and start the `collectd` function.
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
----
systemctl daemon-reload
systemctl enable --now collectd
----

All `collectd` metrics are accessible at port 9103.

With a quick test, you can see if the metrics can be scraped.
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
----
curl localhost:9103/metrics
----

// The offical project on github: https://github.com/collectd/collectd/


=== Processor Counter Monitor (PCM)

Processor Counter Monitor (PCM) can be installed from the GitHub project pages.
Clone the Git repository and build the tool using the following commands.

// TODO: Do we need build tools installed for building PCM? make, GCC etc.? Do we want to mention those?
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
.Installing PCM from source
----
git clone https://github.com/opcm/pcm.git
cd pcm
make pcm-sensor-server.x
----

To start PCM on the observed host, first start a new `screen` session, and then start PCM.footnote:[Starting PCM should really be done by creating a systemd unit.]  
// TODO: replace use of screen by a systemd unit for PCM
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
.Starting PCM
----
screen -S pcm
./pcm-sensor-server.x -d
----

The PCM sensor server binary `pcm-sensor-server.x` has been started in a screen session which can be detached (type `Ctrl+a d`).
This lets the PCM sensor server continue running in the background.

The PCM metrics can be queried from port 9738.


=== Prometheus IPMI exporter

The IPMI exporter can be used to scrape information like temperature, power supply information and fan information.

Create a directory, download and extract the IPMI exporter.
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
----
mkdir ipmi_exporter
cd ipmi_exporter
curl -OL https://github.com/prometheus-community/ipmi_exporter/releases/download/v1.4.0/ipmi_exporter-1.4.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
tar xzvf ipmi_exporter-1.4.0.linux-amd64.tar.gz
----

NOTE: We have been using the version 1.4.0 of the IPMI exporter. For a different release, the URL used in the `curl` command above needs to be adapted. 
      Current releases can be found at the https://github.com/prometheus-community/ipmi_exporter[IPMI Exporter GitHub repository]. 


Some additional packages are required and need to be installed.
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
----
zypper in freeipmi monitoring-plugins-ipmi-sensor1 libipmimonitoring6 monitoring-plugins-ipmi-sensor1
----

To start the IPMI exporter on the observed host, first start a new `screen` session, and then start the exporter.footnote:[Starting the IPMI exporter should really be done by creating a systemd unit.]  
// TODO: replace use of screen by a systemd unit for the IPMI exporter
[subs="attributes,specialchars,verbatim,quotes"]
.Starting PCM
----
screen -S ipmi
cd ipmi_exporter-1.4.0.linux-amd64
./ipmi_exporter
----
The IPMI exporter binary `ipmi_exporter` has been started in a screen session which can be detached (type `Ctrl+a d`).
This lets the exporter continue running in the background.

The metrics of the ipmi_exporter are accessible port 9290.

=== Prometheus
The Prometheus RPM packages can be found in the PackageHub repository.  
This repository needs to be activated via the SUSEConnect command first.
----
SUSEConnect --product PackageHub/15.3/x86_64
----

Prometheus can then easily be installed using the `zypper` command:
----
zypper in golang-github-prometheus-prometheus
----

Edit the Prometheus configuration file `/etc/prometheus/prometheus.yml` to include the scrape job configurations you want to add.

[source]
.Job definition for Node Exporter 
----
  - job_name: node-export
    static_configs:
      - targets: 
        - monint1:9100
----


[source]
.Job definition for Collectd
----
  - job_name: intel-collectd 
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - monint2:9103
        - monint1:9103
----

[source]
.Job definition for PCM
----
  - job_name: intel-pcm
    scrape_interval: 2s
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - monint1:9738
----


[source]
.Prometheus IPMI Exporter
----
  - job_name: ipmi
    scrape_interval: 1m
    scrape_timeout: 30s
    metrics_path: /metrics
    scheme: http
    static_configs:
      - targets:
        - monint1:9290
        - monint2:9104
----

Finally start and enable the Prometheus service:
----
systemctl enable --now prometheus.service 
----

=== Loki
The Loki RPM packages can be found in the PackageHub repository.  
The repository needs to be activated via the SUSEConnect command first, unless you have activated it in the previous steps already.
----
SUSEConnect --product PackageHub/15.3/x86_64
----

Loki can then be installed via the `zypper` command:
----
zypper in loki
----

Edit the Loki configuration file `/etc/loki/loki.yaml` and change the following lines:
[source]
----
chunk_store_config:
  max_look_back_period: 240h 

table_manager:
  retention_deletes_enabled: true 
  retention_period: 240h 
----

Start and enable Loki service:
----
systemctl enable --now loki.service 
----



==== Promtail (Loki agent)
The Promtail RPM packages can be found in the PackageHub repository.  
The repository has to be activated via the SUSEConnect command first, unless you have activated it in the previous steps already.
----
SUSEConnect --product PackageHub/15.3/x86_64
----

Promtail can then be installed via the `zypper` command.
----
zypper in promtail
----

Edit the Promtail configuration file `/etc/loki/promtail.yaml` to include the scrape configurations you want to add.

.To include the systemd-journal, add the following: 
[source]
----
  - job_name: journal 
    journal:
      max_age: 12h
      labels:
        job: systemd-journal
    relabel_configs:
      - source_labels: ['__journal__systemd_unit']
        target_label: 'unit'
----

IMPORTANT: If you are using `systemd-journal`, do not forget to add the `loki` user to the `systemd-journal` group: `usermod -G systemd-journal -a loki`

.To include the HANA alert trace files, add the following: 
[source]
----
  - job_name: HANA 
    static_configs:
    - targets:
        - localhost
      labels:
        job: hana-trace
        host: monint1
        __path__: /usr/sap/IN1/HDB11/monint1/trace/*_alert_monint1.trc
----

IMPORTANT: If you are using SAP logs like the HANA traces, do not forget to add the `loki` user to the `sapsys` group: `usermod -G sapsys -a loki`


Start and enable the Promtail service:
----
systemctl enable --now promtail.service 
----



=== Grafana

The Grafana RPM packages can be found in the PackageHub repository.  
The repository has to be activated via the SUSEConnect command first, unless you have activated it in the previous steps already.
----
SUSEConnect --product PackageHub/15.3/x86_64
----

Grafana can then be installed via `zypper` command:
----
zypper in grafana
----


Start and enable the Grafana server service:
----
systemctl enable --now grafana-server.service 
----


Now connect from a browser to your Grafana instance and log in:

image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-login.png[Grafana Login page,scaledwidth=80%,title="Grafana welcome page"]

==== Grafana data sources
After the login, the data source must be added. On the right hand there is a wheel where a new data source can be added.

image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-datasource-add.png[Grafana add a new data source,scaledwidth=80%,title="Adding a new Grafana data source"]

Add a data source for the Prometheus service.

.Prometheus example
image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-data-prometheus.png[Prometheus data source,scaledwidth=80%,title="Grafana data source for Prometheus DB"]

Also add a data source for Loki.

.Loki example
image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-data-loki.png[Loki data source,scaledwidth=80%,title="Grafana data source for LOKI DB"]

Now Grafana can access both the metrics stored in Prometheus and the log data collected by Loki, to visualize them.

==== Grafana dashboards

Dashboards are how Grafana presents information to the user. 
Prepared dashboards can be downloaded from https://grafana.com/dashboards, or imported using the Grafana ID. 

.Grafana dashboard import
image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-dashboards.png[Dashboard overview,scaledwidth=80%,title="Grafana dashboard import option"]

The dashboards can also be created from scratch. Information from all data sources can be merged into one dashboard.

image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-dashboard-new.png[Dashboard create a new dashboard,scaledwidth=80%,title="Build your own dashboard"]

=== Putting it all together
The picture below shows a dashboard displaying detailed information about the SAP HANA cluster, orchestrated by *pacemaker*.

===============================================================================================
////

== Practical use cases

The following sections describe some practical use cases of the tooling set up in the previous chapter.

=== CPU 
I/O performance is very importand on SAP systems. By looking for the `iowait` metric in command line tools like `top` or `sar`, you can only see a single 
value without any relation. The picture below is showing such a value in a certain timeframe.

image::sap-infra-monitoring-iowait_values.png[iowait over a certain time,scaledwidth=70%,title="iowait over certain timeframe"] 

An iowait of 2% might not show any problem at first glance. But if you look at iowait as part of the whole CPU load, the picture is completely 
different to what you saw before. The reason is that the total CPU load in the example is only a little higher then iowait.

image::sap-infra-monitoring-iowait_procent_of_total.png[iowait in Percent of the total CPU load, scaledwidth=70%,title="iowait in Percent of total CPU load"]

In our example, you now see an iowait value of about 90% of the total CPU load. 

To get the percent of iowait of the total CPU load, use the following formula:
----
100 / (1-CPU_IDLE) * CPU_IOWAIT
----


The metrics used are:

* `node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="idle"}` 
* `node_cpu_seconds_total{mode="iowait"}`

 
Conclusion:: A high iowait in relation to the overall CPU load is indicating a low throughput. As a result, the IO performance might be very bad.
An alert could be triggert by setting a proper threshold if the iowait is going through a certain value.


=== Memory 

Memory performance in modern servers is not only influenced by its speed, but mainly by the way it is accessed. 
The Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) architecture used in modern systems is a way of building very large multi-processor systems so that every CPU 
(that is a group of CPU cores) has a certain amount of memory directly attached to it. 
Multiple CPUs (multiple groups of processors cores) are then connected together using special bus systems (for example UPI) to provide processor data coherency. 
Memory that is "local" to a CPU can be accessed with maximum performance and minimal latency. 
If a process running on a CPU core needs to access memory that is attached to another CPU, it can do so. However, this comes at the price of added latency, 
because it needs to go through the bus system connecting the CPUs.


==== Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) example

There are two exporters at hand which can help to provide the metrics data. The `node_exporter` has an option `--collector.meminfo_numa` 
which must be enabled in the configuration file `/etc/sysconfig/prometheus-node_exporter`. In the example below the `collectd` plugin `numa` was used.

We are focusing on two metrics:

* numa_hit: A process wanted to allocate memory attached to a certain NUMA node (mostly the one it is running on), and succeeded.
* numa_miss: A process wanted to allocate memory attached to a certain NUMA node, but ended up with memory attached to a different NUMA node.

////
numa_foreign  A process wanted to allocate on this node, but ended up with memory from another one.
local_node    A process ran on this node and got memory from it.
other_node    A process ran on this node and got memory from another node.
interleave_hit  Interleaving wanted to allocate from this node and succeeded.
numa_hit: Number of pages allocated from the node the process wanted.
numa_miss: Number of pages allocated from this node, but the process preferred another node.
numa_foreign: Number of pages allocated another node, but the process preferred this node.
local_node: Number of pages allocated from this node while the process was running locally.
other_node: Number of pages allocated from this node while the process was running remotely (on another node).
interleave_hit: Number of pages allocated successfully with the interleave strategy
////

image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-numa.png[NUMA ratio NUMA nodes,scaledwidth=100%,title="NUMA miss ratio for both NUMA nodes"]

The metric used is `collectd_numa_vmpage_action_total`.

Conclusion:: If a process attempts to get a page from its local node, but this node is out of free pages, the 
`numa_miss` of that node will be incremented (indicating that the node is out of memory) and another node 
will accomodate the process's request. To know which nodes are "lending memory" to the 
out-of-memory node, you need to look at `numa_foreign`. Having a high value for `numa_foreign` for a 
particular node indicates that this node's memory is underutilized so the node is frequently accommodating 
memory allocation requests that failed on other nodes. 
A high amout of `numa_miss` would indicate a performance degradation for memory based applications like SAP HANA.

==== Memory module observation

Today more and more application data are hold in the main memory. Examples are _Dynamic random access memory_ (DRAM) or _Persistent memory_ PMEM. 
The observation of this component became quite important. This is because systems with a high amount of main memory, for example multiple terabytes, 
are populated with a corresponding number of modules. The example below represents a memory hardware failure which was not effecting the system with a downtime, 
but a maintenance window should now be scheduled to replace faulty modules.

image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-memory2.png[Memory errors,scaledwidth=100%,title="Memory module failure"]

The example shows a reduction of available space at the same time as the hardware count is increasing.
 
The metric used here is `node_memory_HardwareCorrupted_bytes`.

Memory errors (correctable)  also correlate with the CPU performance as shown in the example below.  
For each of the captured memory failure event, an increase of the CPU I/O is shown.

image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-memory_failure.png[Memory failure metrix,scaledwidth=70%,align="center",title="Memory failure"]

Conclusion:: The risk that one of the modules becomes faulty increases with the total amount of modules per system. 
The observation of memory correctable errors and uncorrectable errors is essential. Features like Intel RAS can 
help to avoid application downtime if the failure could be handled by the hardware. 

=== Network 

Beside the fact that the network work must be available and the throughput must be fit, the network latency is very important, too. 
For cluster setups and applications which are working in a sync mode, like SAP HANA with HANA system replication, the network latency becomes even more relevant.
The `collectd` plugin ping can help here to observe the network latency over time. 
The Grafana dashboard below visualizes the network latency over the past one hour. 

image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-latency.png[collectd ping,scaledwidth=100%,title="collectd latency check"] 

The red line is a threshold which can be used to trigger an alert.

The metrics used here are `collectd_ping` and `collectd_ping_ping_droprate`.

Conclusion:: A high value or peak over a long period (multiple time stamps) indicates network response time issues at least to the ping destination. 
An increasing amount of the `ping_droprate` points to some issues with the ping destination in regards to responding to the ping request.

=== Storage 

////
==== Storage performance

//da nehmen wir was wir haben / I/O und disk full
#stress test
https://linuxreviews.org/HOWTO_Test_Disk_I/O_Performance#fio_-_The_.22flexible_I.2FO_tester.22
fio --randrepet=1 --ioengine=libaio --direct=1 --gtod_reduce=1 --name=test --filename=random_read_write.fio --bs=4k --iodepth=64 --size=250M --readwrite=randrw --rwmixread=80

it enables you to monitor the Read and Write operations of logical disk on your system and set thresholds. You get alerted if below-mentioned metrics reach the levels preset by you:
  Writes/sec – write operations rate.
  Reads/sec – read operations rate.
  Busy time – the % of the elapsed time when your particular disk drive was busy in servicing write or read requests.
  Queue length – the number of requests on the disk that are in the queue.


Conclusion:: can even early detect the potential causes of storage subsystem failures and can reduce the risk of unexpected downtime.
////

==== Storage capacity 
Monitoring disk space utilization of the server is critical and important for maximizing application availability. 
Detecting and monitoring - unexpected or expected - growth of data on the disk will help preventing _disk full_ situations, and therefore application unavailability. 

image::sap-infra-monitoring-grafana-storage-disk.png[growing filesystem,scaledwidth=100%,title="disk free capacity is droping"]

The example above represents a continuously growing file system. 

The metrics used are `node_filesystem_free_bytes` and `node_filesystem_size_bytes`.

After a _disk full_ situation many side effects are shown:

* System load is going high
