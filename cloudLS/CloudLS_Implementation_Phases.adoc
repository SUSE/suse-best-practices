=== Start & Design

The beginning of every cloud project is a design workshop in which
central questions are discussed and answered. Many of the questions
mentioned in chapter 1 must be discussed right at the start of the
project -- if the are not answered properly, all other planning is
basically futile.

A typical workshop with us takes 2-3 days and preferably happens in
your venues. We urge you to call all relevant architects together as you
see fit so that we have all required knowledge right in the workshop.
Usually, people from at least datacenter operations, from network
operations from the storage team and from any application team that
will likely run software on the cloud at a later point in time will join
this workshop.

Typical aspects that will be discussed during the design workshop are,
amongst others:

- Specific business drivers on the customer's end -- why is the customer
  looking into building a cloud and what challenge does he want to tackle?

- Use cases for the cloud -- what workload will it likely be running and
  what is the best technical implementation for that?

- How many environments are required? Is one environment enough or will
  there be a need for different environments such as a production, a
  staging / QA environment, a development environment or a place to test
  and conduct trial & error?

- What are the expectations with regards to the performance of the cloud
  in terms of capacity, bandwidth, latency?

- Are there any specific in-house regulations in place that can impact
  building a cloud? What are the physical conditions?

- Who will be driving the project at both ends? Who will be the people
  in charge, who will have to talk to whom during the implementation and
  are there any bottlenecks or other issues forseeable already?

==== Environment Types

As already explained, a very important question is how many environments
of OpenStack a customer actually needs and what purpose these will be
serving. A full-blown production setup must meet requirements different
from a QA or Development environment. Environments tailor-made for the
purpose of development usually are used to

- test new software functionality
- test configuration changes
- test patches, test temporary product fixes (PTF)
- test upgrade procedures
- troubleshoot an issue
- training and sandbox purposes

In stark contrast to a production environment, a development environment
will typically only require the basic OpenStack services and hence be
easier to setup and maintain. It will also be substantially less complex
and better to adapt.

If the plan, however, is to create a QA environment to test changes
before merging them into the production platform, the QA setup must be
as similar as possible to the production environment. It will typically
have the same complexity and the same operation constraints, too.

==== The Design Workshop

The design of the solution is the most challenging part. In previous
chapters, we have discussed the sizing (number of servers), failure
domains and clusters, networking functionality and and key aspects of
the SUSE OpenStack Cloud and SUSE Enterprise Storage products. During
the design phase of the setup, all these factors are put into relation
of the results of the workshop conducted in the first step to create a
full picture of what the future cloud (or clouds) will look like.

Together with you, our consultants will draft up a design for the setup
and take all factors mentioned previously into consideration and show
how SUSE products such as SUSE Enterprise Linux, SUSE OpenStack Cloud,
SUSE Enterprise Storage, SUSE Manager, SUSE Autoyast and many more help
you to build a cloud fast and effectively. When done, the design will
contain all relevant information such as

- Which OpenStack services will be used (What components in addition to
  the basic components are available and make sense to be used in the
  environment? What about additions such as Monasca?)

- The exact design of the network for the cloud (What SDN solution will
  be used? What are the local requirements? What will the physical
  layout of the network be? What is the target size and can the network
  handle that size -- if not, how does it need to be changed? Are there
  any possible showstoppers present in the design such as firewalls or
  other surprises? How will the cloud integrate into the existing
  structure for (external) networking?)

- what network services are required and how they will be rolled out in
  the future cloud (What protocols must be supported? Examples include
  DNS, DHCP, TFTP, PXE and many more)

- how encryption inside the cloud and when communicating with the outer
  world will be handled (Who can organize possibl required certificates
  for SSL-based connections?)

- what the operations concept looks like and what tools will be used to
  implement the concept (Will SUSE Manager be in place? How will patches
  be handled?)

- what licenses and external products must be acquired, who is in charge
  of acquiring those and until when that can happen

- how well staff personnel is already used to cloud computing and the
  economy of scale in general and to OpenStack in particular and whether
  training will be necessary

WARNING: Moving to the cloud is also an organizational change. Staffing
is a critical component of a successful cloud deployment. Is your staff
trained and prepared -- technically and mentally?

==== CPU and RAM Ratio

During the workshop, a document will be created formally defining the
type and the amount of hardware that needs to be acquired. Of course,
our consultants will make sure to keep the explanations given in the
<<CPU_and_RAM_Ratio>> paragraph in mind -- sizing the hardware correctly
before ordering it eliminates a number of problems that would otherwise
be waiting for you further down the road.

==== Persistent vs. Ephemeral Storage Sizing Rules

Once again, the difference between Persistent and Ephemeral storage is
also important in the context of dimensioning the hardware. If you need a
reminder on why ephemeral storage is tricky, please have another look at
<<Ephemeral_and_Persistent_Storage>> and <<Ephemeral_Issues>> in chapters
2 and 5.

One way or another, the sizing for ephemeral storage and persistent
storage (i.e. the storage available in your Ceph cluster) needs to be
determined. It's important to not mix up ephemeral disks and persistent
block storage in this context. In addition to ephemeral disk, which is
automatically provided for almost every started VM anyway, storage for
Ceph or any other storage solution must be inclued in the planning.

To calculate the minimum disk space needed on a compute node, you need
to determine the highest disk-space-to-RAM ratio from your flavors. For
example:

- Flavor small: 2 GB RAM, 100 GB ephemeral disk => 50 GB disk / 1 GB RAM
- Flavor large: 8 GB RAM, 200 GB ephemeral disk => 25 GB disk / 1 GB RAM

So, 50 GB disk / 1 GB RAM is the ratio that matters. If you multiply that
value by the amount of RAM in gigabytes available on a compute node, you
have the minimum disk space required by ephemeral disks. Pad that value
with sufficient space for the root disks plus a buffer to leave some space
for flavors with a higher disk-space-to-RAM ratio in the future.

After the number of servers (cf. <<ReferenceArchitecture>>) becomes known,
it is also easy to calculate the required network ports and design the
network switch layout.

==== Compatibility with SUSE Linux Enterprise

Last but not least will our consultants during the workshop of course also
ensure that the hardware ending up on the List of Material is compatible
with SUSE Linux Enterprise, which is the fundament of SUSE OpenStack Cloud
and SUSE Enterprise Storage.

Further details on this can also be found online in the SUSE deployment
guide (see section 2.4 Hardware Requirements) and at
https://www.suse.com/documentation/suse-openstack-cloud-7/book_cloud_deploy/data/sec_depl_poc_matrix.html

=== List / Bill Of Material

Based on the outcome of the work done in the workshop, a list of required
hardware and software components and professional services is available
and quotes from vendors are requested. Once these come in, a price tag can
be applied to the solution and the total cost for setting the platform up
become known.

At this stage of the project, management approval is usually required to
determine whether the project will be pursued further or not. It may
also be possible to re-architect parts of the setup to decrease its
price at the cost of having less functionality or less capacity in the
setup.

=== Hardware Setup

If the project gets formal management approval, the acquisition of all
required components is the next logical step. When hardware, software
and professional services are delivered, the assembly of the cloud is to
commence.

Customers that have decided to go with SUSE will, at this stage of the
project, receive a short technical document by SUSE on how to prepare
the individual nodes of the setup to ensure a smooth installation of the
SUSE OpenStack Cloud and SUSE Enterprise Storage components as well as
any other possibly required component such as Autoyast for the automated
deployment of pysical servers.

The technical document will also contain relevant information for people
from other departments such as datacenter operations or network
operations.

Servers will then be installed physically in the datacenter and also get
an operating system.

=== Deployment

Using the determined solution for the roll-out of the cloud, the rollout
will be done in accordance with the governing factors laid out in the
Scope of Work definition created together during the Design Workshop. At
this stage of the project, SUSE architects will usually support you
(even on-site) to ensure a quick and good progress of the installation
of your future setup. We will especially make sure to perform the setup
in the right order so that our mighty deployment tools such as Autoyast
are functional from the get-go and the time required for the deployment
of your cloud is as small as possible.

=== Handover

Once all components are rolled out as desired, formal tests will be done
based on a catalogue of standard tests previously agreed on (SUSE has a
large number of acceptance tests to chose from). If all chosen tests are
completed successfully, a formal handover of the new setup is done and
the responsibility for the installation is tranferred to the customer.

Depending on the level of suppourt that you have acquired together with
the solution, you are, of course, even after this point free to ask for
support or ask any questions that you may have or that arise throughout
the process.

=== Production

After possibly required additional tests on your side, the setup goes
into production mode and start to actively serve customers.

=== Summary

If your goal is to build a large scale cloud environment, there are a
few factors to success you ought to take into consideration. These are,
amongst others,

- *Rely on Open Standards*: Avoid getting locked-in to a certain vendor
  -- both targets are achieved when using Open Source Software.

- *Automate*: Anything in cloud setups that can be automated must be
  automated to allow your smart staff to work on cool new features and
  help improve the environment.

- *Scale out -- but do it!*: The ability to scale out is an absolute key
  requirement and must be present -- but providers also most scale out
  when it is necessary to remain competitive (some companies don't do
  that for financial reasons, facing an effective backslash).

- *Get help*: Building a large scale cloud environment is a tricky and
  difficult task -- find the right partners in time and work together
  with them to turn the project into a guaranteed success.
