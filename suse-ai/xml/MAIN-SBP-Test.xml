        <title>Background</title>

        <para>In many enterprises, a lot of hidden IT knowledge and
            experience exists. This is also the case for SUSE, no matter
            which product you are looking at. </para>

        <para>Our consultants, sales engineers, supporters and partners
            work with our customers on a daily basis to implement,
            strengthen and fine-tune our solutions. They need to find the
            best options how to install third party software on top of our
            operating system, or to get the most out of our customers'
            infrastructure. Many proofs of concept and customer projects
            have been conducted. And many of them are at least partly
            documented. Also, many Technical Information Documents (TIDs)
            are already written and published on the Web page or in the
            Support Knowledgebase at <link
                xlink:href="https://www.suse.com/support/"/>, but it might
            be hard to find documents related to a specific topic.</para>

        <para>Our own infrastructure department has to solve challenges, or
            already detected easy ways to implement a scenario which might
            occur similarly or might be helpful in a customer setup. One of
            our engineers may have detected a certain solution, which is
            not yet documented, to address a common problem in a repeatable
            manner.</para>

        <para>This kind of information is usually <quote>buried</quote> on
            a personal laptop or a team server. Most of the existing
            documents are not in a shape that they can be published
                <quote>as are</quote>, because they refer to customers that
            we are not allowed to name or include some information that
            needs to be removed before publishing. </para>

        <para> In short, a huge part of the knowledge that exists in our
            company is not publicly available for our colleagues, partners
            or customers. And if publicly available in any form, it often
            is hard to find. </para>

            <title>Mission</title>

            <para>The purpose of the &sbp; is to change this situation.
                We want to make existing knowledge and experience available
                to a broader audience, and we want to promote it via a
                recognizable series of documents.</para>

            <title>Vision</title>

            <para>With the &sbp;, we aim to introduce a new series of
                documents that provides reliable technical information. We
                want to establish a new <quote>go-to source</quote> for the
                usage and implementation of SUSE products and solutions,
                also in combination with third party software and
                hardware.</para>

            <para>Our goal is to make the &sbp; series similarly
                prominent to the widely recognized IBM Redbooks which can
                be found at <link xlink:href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com"
                />. We want volunteers knocking at our door to contribute
                and feeling honored if we pick their proposed topics for
                the &sbp;.</para>
        </sect2>

        <sect2 xml:id="sec-whataresbp">
            <title>What Exactly Are the &sbp;?</title>

            <para>In contrast to the SUSE product documentation which
                mainly guides through SUSE software installation and usage,
                the &sbp; are a series of topic-driven documentation
                and provide installation and implementation
                experiences.</para>

            <para>A &sbp; document describes a technical scenario or
                solution that is not covered by the general comprehensive
                SUSE product documentation. Such a scenario can also
                include third-party software and implementations (partly)
                done by partners. </para>

            <para>While our SUSE product documentation is delivered in
                parallel with a new product version, the &sbp; will not
                focus on newly launched products, but on products already
                introduced to and established in the market.</para>

            <para>Usually the scenario or solution has already been
                implemented in a real-life scenario at a customer's site.
                It can include â€“ but is not limited to:</para>

            <para>&sbp; should be replicable and adaptable, they aim to
                save time as they use existing knowledge for further
                replication, and they should be sustainable and easy to
                update.</para>

            <para>Depending on the complexity of the topic, &sbp; can
                differ regarding their length. Typically, a &sbp;
                document is between 5 and 30 pages in length. </para>

            <para>&sbp; target existing customers who work on a
                specific solution or must solve a concrete technical
                problem. We mainly address system administrators that have
                to set-up and implement the technical solution. &sbp;
                can also be of interest to technical architects as well as

            <title>Advantages of &sbp;</title>
            <para>Sharing best practices is a good way to improve
                performance by replicating successes throughout an
                organization. In addition, you can save costs through
                increased productivity and efficiency.</para>
            <para>For our customers, the SUSE Best Practices provide
                detailed and experience-proven information about
                implementations that successfully work. They can also share
                their experiences with others.</para>
            <para>We also want to ensure, that our colleagues (Sales
                Engineers, Consultants) who work on Proof of Concepts or on
                implementations at customer sites do not have to duplicate
                efforts or <quote>reinvent the wheel</quote>, but can save
                time and effort by capitalizing from existing documentation
                of similar setups.</para>
            <para>Our sales colleagues benefit from &sbp; by being able
                to respond to many more customer requests much
                quicker.</para>
            <para>The support teams can minimize time and effort in
                reproducing scenarios that already have been implemented at
                a customers site by other colleagues.</para>

            definition of these Marketing documents. </para>

        <para> The target audience for the Marketing documents are mainly
            technical or business <emphasis role="bold">decision

            that do not yet run SUSE products, or customers to whom we want

        <title>Prerequisites for &sbp;</title>

        <para>The main purpose of &sbp; is to make knowledge that
            already exists (in written form) easily accessible for a
            broader internal and external audience. We can achieve this
            with the help of the documentation team via streamlined
            approaches and standardized processes.</para>

        <para>This means also that the main content for a &sbp; paper

        <para>One reason why the SUSE documentation team cannot deliver the
            content is that we cannot reproduce the scenarios and
            environments implemented at our customers` sites. We heavily
            rely on the know-how and operating experience of our colleagues
            that are working directly with our partners or customers. </para>

        <para>A minimum of 80 percent of a proposed or requested topic
            already needs to be available in written form. Before starting
            a new project, subject matter experts who worked together with
            a partner or customer on the implementation of the topic need
            to be defined, and they need to be committed to work on the
            paper together with the documentation team. </para>

        <para>The content for updates of &sbp; has to come from the
            original content provider, or from another subject matter
            expert familiar with the topic, defined in advance. </para>

            several means (for example, key content providers will be named
            as authors of a document, they will receive a limited edition

            We plan to develop and implement a new portal for &sbp;
