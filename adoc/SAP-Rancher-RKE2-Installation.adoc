Creating new RKE2 clusters is very easy when using {rancher}.


Go to the home menu of your {rancher} instance.
Click the *Create* button on the right side of the screen, as shown here:

The window shows you the available options for creating new Kubernetes clusters.
Make sure the toggle button on the right side of the screen is set to *RKE2/K3s* as shown below:

If you want to create Kubernetes clusters on existing (virtual) machines, select the *Custom* option at the very bottom, as shown in the image below:

Next, you will see a window to configure your Kubernetes cluster. It will look similar to the image below:

Here, you need to name the cluster. The name will only be used within {rancher}. It will not affect your workloads.
In the next step, make sure you select a Kubernetes version that is supported by the workload you want to deploy.

If you do not have any further requirements to Kubernetes, you can click the *Create* button at the very bottom.
In any other cases talk to your administrators before making adjustements.

After you clicked *Create*, you should see a screen like this:

Now, in a first step, select the roles your node(s) should receive.
A common high availability setup holds:

* 3 x etcd / controll plane nodes
* 3 x worker nodes

The next step is to copy the registration command to the target machines' shell and execute it.
If your {rancher} instance holds a self-signed certifcate, make sure to activate the text bar holding the registration command in the check box below.

You can run the command on all nodes in parallel. You do not need to wait until a single node is down.
When all machines are registered, you can see the cluster status at the top, changing from "updating" to "active".
At this point in time, your Kubernetes cluster is ready to be used.
