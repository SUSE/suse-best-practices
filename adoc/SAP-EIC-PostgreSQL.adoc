:pg: PostgreSQL
:redis: Redis

IMPORTANT::
SUSE does not offer database support for {pg} on Kubernetes.
To get support, go to 
link:https://www.postgresql.org/support/[The PostgreSQL Global Development Group]


IMPORTANT::
In this guide we'll describe one variant of installing {pg}.
There are other possible ways to setup {pg} which are not focussed in this guide. It is also possible to install {pg} as a single instance on top of our operation system.
We will focus on installing {pg} into a kubernetes cluster, because we also need a {redis} database and we will put them together into one cluster. 

==== Deploying {pg}
Even though {pg} is available for deployment using the {rancher} Apps, we recommend to use the {rac}.
The {pg} chart can be found at https://apps.rancher.io/applications/postgresql .

===== Deploy the chart

{rancher} instances prior to version 2.9 can not integrate the {rac}. Thus you need to use the console and Helm.
The easiest way to do so is to use the built-in shell in {rancher}. To access it, navigate to your cluster and click on *Kubectl Shell* as shown below:

A shell will open as in the given picture:

You will need to login to the {rac} which can be done like:
----
$ helm registry login dp.apps.rancher.io/charts -u <yourUser> -p <your-token>
----

To download the helm chart execute:
----
$ helm pull oci://dp.apps.rancher.io/charts/postgres --untar
----

Override or edit the *values.yaml* file which holds some configuration for the {pg} Helm chart.
The config may look like:

----
global:
  # -- Global override for container image registry pull secrets
  imagePullSecrets: ["application-collection"]
images:
  postgresql:
    # -- Image name to use for the PostgreSQL container
    repository: dp.apps.rancher.io/containers/postgresql
    # -- Image tag to use for the PostgreSQL container
    tag: "15.7"
auth:
  # -- PostgreSQL username for the superuser
  postgresUsername: postgres
  # -- PostgreSQL password for the superuser
  postgresPassword: "<your_password>"
  # -- Replication username
  replicationUsername: replication
  # -- Replication password
  replicationPassword: "<your_password>"
tls:
  # -- Enable SSL/TLS
  enabled: false
  # -- Name of the secret containing the PostgreSQL certificates
  existingSecret: "postgresqlcert"
  # -- Whether or with what priority a secure SSL TCP/IP connection will be negotiated with the server. Valid values: prefer (default), disable, allow, require, verify-ca, verify-full
  sslMode: "verify-full"
  # -- Certificate filename in the secret (will be ignored if empty)
  certFilename: "server.pem"
  # -- Certificate key filename in the secret (will be ignored if empty)
  keyFilename: "server.key"
  # -- CA certificate filename in the secret (will be ignored if empty)
  caCertFilename: "root.pem"
----

To install the application run:
----
$ helm install -f values.yaml --namespace=postgresql ./postgresql
----
