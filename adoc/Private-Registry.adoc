= SUSE Private Registry Powered by Harbor 2.1

== Introduction

Cloud Native Application Development and Delivery methods require a registry and a CI/CD (Continuous Integration/Delivery) instance for the development and production of container images.
In many cases, using a public container registry and CI/CD does not allow for enough control. A link:https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/containers/images/#using-a-private-registry[private registry] can provide that level of control.

{sprpbh} is a fully OCI-compliant container-image registry solution that gives the development team a place to manage, deploy and sign container images (using link:https://docs.docker.com/notary/getting_started/[Notary]), fully control access to OCI container images and helm charts via RBAC (role-based access control), and do vulnerability scanning with link:https://github.com/aquasecurity/trivy[Trivy].
It is based on link:https://goharbor.io/docs/2.1.0/[Harbor] on top of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server.
