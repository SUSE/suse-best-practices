== Motivation
Agility is the name of the game in modern application development.  This is driving developers toward more agile, 
cloud native methodologies that focus on microservices architectures and streamlined workflows.  
Container technologies, like Kubernetes, embody this agile approach and help enable cloud native transformation.

SUSE Rancher simplifies Kubernetes management, empowering you to take control of your IT landscape and create 
an agile data platform that accelerates achievement of your goals.  
Rancher enables you to manage dynamic, robust, multi-cluster Kubernetes environments and supports any 
CNCF-certified Kubernetes distribution.  With built-in resilience and scalability, unified security and policy management, 
and a rich catalog of shared tools and services, Rancher helps you accelerate development-to-production and innovate everywhere.

MongoDB is a cloud native database technology that brings all the power of the traditional, 
relational database and provides a more natural way to work with modern data.  
MongoDB offers a variety of compelling features that make it a natural partner for a SUSE Rancher agile data platform.  
These include:

Flexible Data Model:: MongoDB’s dynamic schema is ideal for handling changing requirements and continuous delivery.  
You can seamlessly roll out new features without having to update existing records — a process that can take weeks for traditional, 
relational databases.  DevOps teams can quickly model data against an ever-changing environment and roll these changes into production. 
This results in faster time to market and faster time to value.

Resilience:: MongoDB’s replica sets have built-in redundancy, providing greater resilience and enhancing disaster recovery capabilities.  
Administrators can even isolate operational workloads from analytical reporting in single database cluster to ensure sufficient 
resources are allocated to handle demand.

Monitoring and Automation::  Heterogeneous services increase the level of complexity and can stall productivity. 
Technology that handles monitoring and automation is critical to keeping DevOps teams productive as their environments evolve. 
MongoDB Ops Manager features visualization, custom dashboards, and automated alerting.  It tracks, reports, processes, 
and visualizes 100+ key database and systems-health metrics, including operations counters, CPU utilization, replication status, 
and node status.

Scalability:: MongoDB’s auto-sharding automatically partitions and distributes the database across nodes, serving IT infrastructures 
that require dynamic, high-performance capabilities.  Distribution can even span different geographic regions.  
MongoDB is ideally suited to scale-out architectures.


With enterprise-grade products, proactive support, and success-focused services and training, SUSE and MongoDB deliver 
an agile data platform that helps organizations achieve their cloud native goals.


== Technical overview

SUSE Rancher is a lightweight Kubernetes installer that supports installation on bare-metal and virtualized servers.  
Rancher solves a common issue in the Kubernetes community: installation complexity.  With Rancher, Kubernetes installation is simplified, 
regardless of what operating systems and platforms you are running.

This document reviews considerations for deploying and managing a highly available, MongoDB NoSQL database on a 
SUSE Rancher Kubernetes cluster.

In practice, the process is as follows:

* Install a Kubernetes cluster through Rancher Kubernetes Engine
* Install a cloud native storage solution on Kubernetes
* Deploy https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/master/[MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator]
* Configure a storage class and define storage requirements via Operator
* Test failover by killing or cordoning nodes in your cluster


== Value of HA for data

One of the primary benefits of running a Kubernetes environment is flexibility, the ability to easily adapt to varying circumstances.  
Traditional database deployments exist in fairly static configurations and environments.  The beauty of running a data-oriented service 
on Kubernetes lies in maintaining stability while enabling adaptability to meet real-world situations.

Imagine a scenario where your e-commerce site is consistently taking 100 orders per day.  Suddenly, a viral marketing event occurs, 
and your site is pushed to 5000 orders per day for a day.  This increase could easily lead to data overload – or worse, 
corruption or downtime, which could result to considerable loss of revenue.  Having a way to design for such failure scenarios 
and maintain resilient operations is a tangible market advantage.

MongoDB can run in a single node configuration and in a clustered configuration using replica sets (not to be confused with 
Kubernetes Stateful Sets). A replica set is a group of MongoDB instances that maintain the same data. A replica set contains 
several data-bearing nodes and optionally one arbiter node. Of the data-bearing nodes, one and only one member is deemed the primary node,
while the other nodes are deemed secondary nodes.  Resiliency of the data is achieved, as illustrated below.

image::rancher-mongo-1.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

In this configuration, the failover process generally completes within a minute.  
It may take about 30 seconds for the members of a replica set to declare a primary inaccessible. 
One of the remaining secondaries will then be enabled as the "new primary".  The election itself may take another 10 to 30 seconds.  
During this time, the data will be preserved in a virtually seamless way for dependent services.


== Setting up a cluster with SUSE Rancher

SUSE Rancher is a tool to install and configure Kubernetes in a choice of environments including bare metal, virtual machines, and IaaS. 
Rancher is a complete container management platform built on upstream Kubernetes.
It consists of three major components:

* A certified Kubernetes Distribution – Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE)
* A Kubernetes Management platform (Rancher)
* Application Catalog and management (Third-party)

Rancher has the capabilities to manage any Kubernetes cluster from a central location, via the
Rancher server.  As illustrated below, Rancher can manage any Kubernetes flavor and is not restricted to RKE.

image::rancher-mongo-2.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]

For reference, see Rancher deployment guides for specific details on installation.    
By the end of this step, you should have a cluster with one master and three worker nodes.

image::rancher-mongo-3.png[scaledwidth="75%", align="center"]


== Storage considerations

When deploying an application that needs to retain data, you need to create persistent storage. 
Persistent storage allows you to store application data external from the pod running your application. 
This storage practice allows you to maintain application data, even if the application’s pod fails.

A variety of storage options exist and can be used to create an HA data solution with Rancher.  
Some considerations you may need to follow for your storage solution include:

* Volumes as persistent storage for the distributed stateful applications

* Partitioned block storage for Kubernetes volumes with or without a cloud provider

* Replicated block storage across multiple nodes and data centers to increase availability

* Secondary data backup storage (for example, NFS or S3)

* Cross-cluster disaster recovery volumes

* Recurring volume snapshots

* Recurring backups to secondary storage

* Non-disruptive upgrades



Some common storage solutions to consider are as follows:

https://longhorn.io[Longhorn]:: Distributed block storage system for Kubernetes. Originally developed by Rancher Labs.  
Currently sandbox project of the Cloud Native Computing Foundation

https://openebs.io[OpenEBS]:: Open source, CNCF Sandbox storage with flexible storage engine options - requires third-party integration

https://ceph.io[Ceph]:: Powerful, open source, general purpose storage in the CNCF Sandbox – requires third-party integration

https://portworx.com[Portworx]:: Proprietary solution with Rancher certified integration - installation steps can be found https://docs.portworx.com/install-with-other/rancher/rancher-2.x[here]



=== Setting up your storage

Before proceeding, be sure that you understand the Kubernetes concepts of persistent volumes, persistent volume claims, and 
storage classes.  For more information, refer to 
https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/volumes-and-storage/how-storage-works[How Persistent Storage Works] in the Rancher documentation.

The workflow for setting up existing storage is as follows:

. Ensure you have access to set up your persistent storage. This may be storage in an infrastructure provider, or it could be your own storage.

. Add a persistent volume (PV) that refers to the persistent storage.

. Add a persistent volume claim (PVC) that refers to the PV.

. Mount the PVC as a volume in your workload.

For further details and prerequisites, read the Rancher documentation section 
https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/volumes-and-storage/attaching-existing-storage[Setting Up Existing Storage].


The overall workflow for provisioning new storage is as follows:

1. Add a StorageClass and configure it to use your storage provider. The StorageClass could refer to storage in an infrastructure provider, or it could refer to your own storage.
2. Add a persistent volume claim (PVC) that refers to the storage class.
3. Mount the PVC as a volume for your workload.

See section https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.x/en/cluster-admin/volumes-and-storage/provisioning-new-storage[Dynamically Provisioning New Storage in Rancher] for details and prerequisites.


=== Creating a storage class for MongoDB

When the Kubernetes cluster is running and storage is configured, it is time to deploy a highly available MongoDB database.

MongoDB resources are created in Kubernetes as custom resources. After you create or update a MongoDB Kubernetes resource specification, 
you direct MongoDB Kubernetes Operator to apply this specification to your Kubernetes environment. 
Kubernetes Operator creates the defined StatefulSets, services and other Kubernetes resources. 
After the Operator finishes creating those objects, it updates the Ops Manager deployment configuration to reflect changes.

The following example shows a resource specification for a 
https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/glossary/#term-replica-set[replica set] configuration:

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
kind: MongoDB
metadata:
  name: my-replica-set
spec:
  members: 3
  version: "4.2.2-ent"
  service: my-service
  opsManager: # Alias of cloudManager
    configMapRef:

          labelSelector:
            matchLabels:
              app: "my-app"
        logs:
          storage: "500M"
          storageClass: standard

            operator: In
            values:
            - e2e-az1
            - e2e-az2

      internalCluster: "X509"
  additionalMongodConfig:
    net:
      ssl:
        mode: preferSSL
----

Full details can be found https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/master/reference/k8s-operator-specification[here].


== Creating a persistent volume

You can now create a persistent volume claim (PVC) based on the storage class. Dynamic provisioning will be created without explicitly 
provisioning a persistent volume (PV). As part of deployment, the Kubernetes operator creates 
https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/storage/persistent-volumes[persistent volumes] for the Ops Manager StatefulSets. 
The Kubernetes container uses persistent volumes to maintain the cluster state between restarts.


== Deploying MongoDB Kubernetes Operator

Kubernetes needs help creating and managing stateful applications like databases.  The typical lifecycle events of a MongoDB cluster may 
include provisioning storage and computing power, configuring network connections, setting up users, and more.  
This is where the MongoDB Enterprise Kubernetes Operator comes in.  It translates the human knowledge of how to create a MongoDB 
instance into a scalable, repeatable, and standardized methodology.  And it does this by using the built-in Kubernetes API and tools.
To use the operator, you simply need to provide it with the specifications for your MongoDB cluster.  
The operator uses this information to direct Kubernetes into performing all the required steps to achieve the end state.

The general commands for deploying the MongoDB Enterprise Operator are:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl describe deployments mongodb-enterprise-operator -n <namespace>


helm install <chart-name> helm_chart \
     --values helm_chart/values.yaml \
----


The next step after deploying the operator is to create the database using a `yaml` file, such as:

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
kind: MongoDB
metadata:

  name: <my-standalone>

spec:

  version: "4.2.2-ent"

  opsManager:
    configMapRef:

      name: <configMap.metadata.name>

            # Must match metadata.name in ConfigMap file

  credentials: <mycredentials>

  type: Standalone
  persistent: true
----


Now, you can deploy the database and check the status of the deployment with:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl apply -f <standalone-conf>.yaml

kubectl get mdb <resource-name> -o yaml
----



At this point, MongoDB has been deployed via the operator. Additional settings can be applied to create 
https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/stable/tutorial/deploy-replica-set/[replica] sets to further enhance data availability.  
Also, sharded clusters can be created to enable greater throughput across a distributed system.

Additionally, see specific https://github.com/mongodb/mongodb-enterprise-kubernetes[documentation] and steps for full installation 
and configuration options.


== Deploying MongoDB Ops Manager resource

Kubernetes needs help creating and managing stateful applications like databases.  The typical lifecycle events of a MongoDB cluster may 
include provisioning, storage and compute. Ops Manager can be deployed via the MongoDB Kubernetes Operator to manage MongoDB resources 
in a cluster.  The Operator manages the lifecycle of each of these deployments differently.
The Operator manages Ops Manager deployments using the Ops Manager custom resource. The Operator watches the custom resource’s 
specification for changes. When the specification changes, the Operator validates the changes and makes the appropriate updates to the 
resources in the cluster.
Ops Manager custom resources specification defines the following components: Application Database, Ops Manager application, 
and Backup Daemon. Summarized instructions to create Ops Manager are below, but full details can be found 
https://docs.mongodb.com/kubernetes-operator/master/tutorial/deploy-om-container[here].

To begin, run the following command to execute all `kubectl` commands in the namespace you created:

[source,bash]
----
kubectl config set-context $(kubectl config current-context) --namespace=<namespace>
----

Create Ops Manager object as below:

[source,bash]
----
apiVersion: mongodb.com/v1
kind: MongoDBOpsManager
metadata:
  name: <myopsmanager>
spec:
  replicas: 1
  version: <opsmanagerversion>
  adminCredentials: <adminusercredentials> # Should match metadata.name
  externalConnectivity:
    type: LoadBalancer
  applicationDatabase:
    members: 3
    version: <mongodbversion>
    persistent: true
----


== Loading and querying the database

When the database has been created, you can populate it with some sample data.

First, find the pod that is running MongoDB:

[source,bash]
----
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=mongo | grep Running | grep 1/1 | awk '{print $1}'`
----

Then, access the MongoDB shell on that POD instance:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl exec -it $POD mongo
MongoDB shell version v4.0.0
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
MongoDB server version: 4.0.0
Welcome to the MongoDB shell.
----

Now, using the MongoDB shell, you can populate a collection:

[source,bash]
----
db.ships.insert({name:'USS Enterprise-D',operator:'Starfleet',type:'Explorer',class:'Galaxy',crew:750,codes:[10,11,12]})
db.ships.insert({name:'USS Prometheus',operator:'Starfleet',class:'Prometheus',crew:4,codes:[1,14,17]})
db.ships.insert({name:'USS Defiant',operator:'Starfleet',class:'Defiant',crew:50,codes:[10,17,19]})
db.ships.insert({name:'IKS Buruk',operator:' Klingon Empire',class:'Warship',crew:40,codes:[100,110,120]})
db.ships.insert({name:'IKS Somraw',operator:' Klingon Empire',class:'Raptor',crew:50,codes:[101,111,120]})
db.ships.insert({name:'Scimitar',operator:'Romulan Star Empire',type:'Warbird',class:'Warbird',crew:25,codes:[201,211,220]})
db.ships.insert({name:'Narada',operator:'Romulan Star Empire',type:'Warbird',class:'Warbird',crew:65,codes:[251,251,220]})
----

And you can run some operations on the MongoDB collection.

For example, find one arbitrary document:

[source,bash]
----
db.ships.findOne()
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("5b5c16221108c314d4c000cd"),
	"name" : "USS Enterprise-D",
	"operator" : "Starfleet",
	"type" : "Explorer",
	"class" : "Galaxy",
	"crew" : 750,
	"codes" : [
		10,
		11,
		12
	]
}
----


You can also find ALL documents and apply some basic formatting:

[source,bash]
----
db.ships.find().pretty()
 {
 	"_id" : ObjectId("5b5c16221108c314d4c000d1"),
 	"name" : "IKS Somraw",
 	"operator" : " Klingon Empire",
 	"class" : "Raptor",
 	"crew" : 50,
 	"codes" : [
 		101,
 		111,
 		120
 	]
 }
 {
 	"_id" : ObjectId("5b5c16221108c314d4c000d2"),
 	"name" : "Scimitar",
 	"operator" : "Romulan Star Empire",
 	"type" : "Warbird",
 	"class" : "Warbird",
 	"crew" : 25,
 	"codes" : [
 		201,
 		211,
 		220
 	]
 }
----


And you can get a list of the names of the ships:

[source,bash]
----
 db.ships.find({}, {name:true, _id:false})
 { "name" : "USS Enterprise-D" }
 { "name" : "USS Prometheus" }
 { "name" : "USS Defiant" }
 { "name" : "IKS Buruk" }
 { "name" : "IKS Somraw" }
 { "name" : "Scimitar" }
 { "name" : "Narada" }
----


== Simulating node failure & restoration

Next, simulate a node failure by cordoning off the node on which MongoDB is running:

[source,bash]
----
$ NODE=`kubectl get pods -l app=mongo -o wide | grep -v NAME | awk '{print $7}'`

$ kubectl cordon ${NODE} node/ip-172-31-29-132.compute.internal cordoned
----

The above command disables scheduling on one of the nodes.
Check this with:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get nodes
NAME                                           STATUS                     ROLES               AGE   VERSION
ip-172-31-24-121.compute.internal   Ready                      worker              47h   v1.13.4
ip-172-31-26-49.compute.internal    Ready                      controlplane,etcd   47h   v1.13.4
ip-172-31-28-65.compute.internal    Ready                      worker              47h   v1.13.4
ip-172-31-29-132.compute.internal   Ready,SchedulingDisabled   worker              47h   v1.13.4
----


Now, go ahead and delete the MongoDB pod:

[source,bash]
----
$ POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=mongo -o wide | grep -v NAME | awk '{print $1}'`
$ kubectl delete pod ${POD}
pod "mongo-68cc69bc95-7q96h" deleted
----

When the pod is deleted, it is relocated to the node with the replicated data, even when that node is in a different zone.  
Each pod is rescheduled on the exact node where the data is stored.

Verify this:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl get pods -l app=mongo -o wide
NAME                     READY     STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE       IP               NODE
mongo-68cc69bc95-thqbm   1/1       Running   0          19s       192.168.82.119   ip-172-31-24-121.compute.internal
----

Note that a new pod has been created and scheduled in a different node.

Next, uncordon the node to bring it back to action:

[source,bash]
----
$ kubectl uncordon ${NODE}
node/ip-172-31-29-132.compute.internal uncordoned
----


Finally, verify that the data is still available.

To do so, find the pod name and run the ‘exec’ command, then access the Mongo shell:

[source,bash]
----
POD=`kubectl get pods -l app=mongo | grep Running | grep 1/1 | awk '{print $1}'`
kubectl exec -it $POD mongo
MongoDB shell version v4.0.0
connecting to: mongodb://127.0.0.1:27017
MongoDB server version: 4.0.0
Welcome to the MongoDB shell.
----


After that, query the collection to verify that the data is intact.

Find one arbitrary document:

[source,bash]
----
db.ships.findOne()
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("5b5c16221108c314d4c000cd"),
	"name" : "USS Enterprise-D",
	"operator" : "Starfleet",
	"type" : "Explorer",
	"class" : "Galaxy",
	"crew" : 750,
	"codes" : [
		10,
		11,
		12
	]
}
----


Now, find all documents and apply formatting:

[source,bash]
----
db.ships.find().pretty()
…..
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("5b5c16221108c314d4c000d1"),
	"name" : "IKS Somraw",
	"operator" : " Klingon Empire",
	"class" : "Raptor",
	"crew" : 50,
	"codes" : [
		101,
		111,
		120
	]
}
{
	"_id" : ObjectId("5b5c16221108c314d4c000d2"),
	"name" : "Scimitar",
	"operator" : "Romulan Star Empire",
	"type" : "Warbird",
	"class" : "Warbird",
	"crew" : 25,
	"codes" : [
		201,
		211,
		220
	]
}
----

For further validation, you can run all the same initial steps to compare that data is still available with originally queried values.
