=== Introduction

{sles4sapreg} is optimized in various ways for {SAPreg} applications.
This guide provides detailed information about installing and customizing
*{sles4sap} for {HANA} system replication in the {usecase} scenario*.

“{SAP} customers invest in {HANA}” is the conclusion reached by a recent
market study carried out by Pierre Audoin Consultants (PAC). In Germany,
half of the companies expect {HANA} to become the dominant
database platform in the {SAP} environment. Often the “{SAP}
Business Suite* powered by {HANA}*” scenario is already being discussed
in concrete terms.

{SUSE} is accommodating this development by offering {sles4sap},
the recommended and supported operating system for {HANA}. In close
collaboration with {SAP}, cloud service and hardware partners, {SUSE} provides two
resource agents for customers to ensure the high availability of {HANA} system
replications.

==== Abstract

This guide describes planning, setup, and basic testing of {sles4sap} based on
the high availability solution scenario "{SAPHANA} Scale-Up System Replication Performance Optimized".

From the application perspective, the following variants are covered:

- plain system replication

- system replication with secondary site read-enabled

- multi-tier (chained) system replication

- multi-target system replication

- multi-tenant database containers for all above

From the infrastructure perspective, the following variants are covered:

- 2-node cluster with  disk-based SBD

- 3-node cluster with diskless SBD

- On-premises deployment on physical and virtual machines

- Public cloud deployment (usually needs additional documentation focusing on the cloud specific implementation details)

Deployment automation simplifies roll-out. There are several options available,
particularly on public cloud platfoms (for example https://www.suse.com/c/automating-the-sap-hana-high-availability-cluster-deployment-for-microsoft-azure/).
Ask your public cloud provider or your SUSE contact for details.

See <<cha.hana-sr.scenario>> for details.

==== Scale-up versus scale-out

// TODO PRIO2: add stonith resource to the graphic

The first set of scenarios includes the architecture and development of _scale-up_ solutions.

.{HANA} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster
image::hana_sr_in_cluster.svg[scaledwidth=70.0%]

For these scenarios, {SUSE} has developed the scale-up
resource agent package `{SAPHanaSR}`. System replication helps to
replicate the database data from one computer to another computer to compensate for database failures (single-box replication).

//.{HANA} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster
//image::hana_sr_in_cluster.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]

The second set of scenarios includes the architecture and development of
_scale-out_ solutions (multi-box replication). For these scenarios, {SUSE}
has developed the scale-out resource agent package `{SAPHanaSR}-ScaleOut`.

.{HANA} System Replication Scale-Out in the Cluster
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Cluster.svg[scaledwidth=70.0%]

With this mode of operation, internal {HANA} high availability (HA)
mechanisms and the resource agent must work together or be coordinated
with each other. {HANA} system replication automation for scale-out
is described in a separate document available on our documentation Web page
at {reslibrary}. The document for scale-out is named _"{docScaleOut}"_.

==== Scale-up scenarios and resource agents

[[scenarios]]

{SUSE} has implemented the scale-up scenario with the `{SAPHanaRA}` resource
agent (RA), which performs the actual check of the {HANA} database
instances. This RA is configured as a multi-state resource. In the
scale-up scenario, the promoted RA instance assumes responsibility for the {HANA}
databases running in primary mode. The non-promoted RA instance is responsible for
instances that are operated in synchronous (secondary) status.

To make configuring the cluster as simple as possible, SUSE has
developed the `{SAPHanaTopRA}` resource agent. This RA runs on all nodes
of a {sles4sap} cluster and gathers information about the
statuses and configurations of {HANA} system replications. It is
designed as a normal (stateless) clone.

{HANA} system replication for scale-up is supported in the following
scenarios or use cases:

* *Performance optimized* (_A => B_). This scenario and setup *is described
in this document.*
+
.{HANA} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-perfOpt.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
In the performance optimized scenario an {HANA} RDBMS site A is synchronizing
with an {HANA} RDBMS site B on a second node. As the {HANA} RDBMS on the second node
is configured to pre-load the tables, the takeover time is typically very
short.
+
One big advance of the performance optimized scenario of {HANA} is the
possibility to allow read access on the secondary database site. To support
this *read enabled* scenario, a second virtual IP address is added to the cluster
and bound to the secondary role of the system replication.
* *Cost optimized* (_A => B, Q_). This scenario and setup is described
in another document available from the documentation Web page ({reslibrary}).
The document for _cost optimized_ is named _"{docCostOpt}"_.
+
.{HANA} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - cost optimized
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-costOpt2.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
In the cost optimized scenario, the second node is also used for a
stand-alone non-replicated {HANA} RDBMS system (like QAS or TST). Whenever a takeover
is needed, the non-replicated system must be stopped first. As the
productive secondary system on this node must be limited in using system
resources, the table preload must be switched off. A possible
takeover needs longer than in the performance optimized use case.
+
In the cost optimized scenario, the secondary needs to be running in a reduced
memory consumption configuration. This is why _read enabled_ must not be used in this
scenario.
+
As already explained, the secondary {HANA} database must run with memory resource
restrictions. The HA/DR provider needs to remove these memory restrictions when a
takeover occurs. This is why multi SID (also MCOS) must not be used in this scenario.

* *Multi-tier* (_A => B -> C_) and *Multi-target* (_B <= A => C_).
+
.{HANA} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized chain
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-Chain.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
A _multi-tier_ system replication has an additional target. In the past, this third
side must have been connected to the secondary (chain topology). With current {HANA}
versions, the _multiple target topology_ is allowed by {sap}.
Have a look at the scenarios and prerequisites section below or consult the
manual pages SAPHanaSR(7) and SAPHanaSR.py(7) for details.
// TODO PRIO3: link to section
+
.{HANA} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized multi-target
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-MultiTarget.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
Multi-tier and multi-target systems are implemented as described in this document.
Only the first replication pair (A and B) is handled by the cluster itself.

* *Multi-tenancy* or MDC.
+
Multi-tenancy is supported for all above scenarios and use cases. This scenario is supported since {HANA} SPS09.
The setup and configuration from a cluster point of view is the same for multi-tenancy and single container.
Thus you can use the above documents for both kinds of scenarios.

// TODO PRIO1: Add new restrictions here (think about multi-target, handshake, ...)

==== The concept of the performance optimized scenario

In case of failure of the primary {HANA} on node 1 (node or database
instance) the cluster first tries to start the takeover process. This
allows to use the already loaded data at the secondary site. Typically
the takeover is much faster than the local restart.

To achieve an automation of this resource handling process, you must
use the {HANA} resource agents included in {SAPHanaSR}. System
replication of the productive database is automated with {SAPHanaRA} and
{SAPHanaTopRA}.

The cluster only allows a takeover to the secondary site if the {HANA}
system replication was in sync until the point when the service of the primary
got lost. This ensures that the last commits processed on the primary site are
already available at the secondary site.

{SAP} did improve the interfaces between {HANA} and external software, such as
cluster frameworks. These improvements also include the implementation of {HANA}
call outs in case of special events, such as status changes for services or system replication
channels. These call outs are also called HA/DR providers. These interfaces can be used by
implementing {HANA} hooks written in python. {SUSE} has enhanced the SAPHanaSR package
to include such {HANA} hooks to optimize the cluster interface. Using the
{HANA} hooks described in this document allows to inform the cluster immediately
if the {HANA} system replication is broken. In addition to the {HANA} hook status,
the cluster continues to poll the system replication status on a regular basis.

You can adjust the level of automation by setting the parameter `AUTOMATED_REGISTER`.
If automated registration is activated, the cluster will automatically register
a former failed primary to become the new secondary. Refer to the manual pages SAPHanaSR(7) and ocf_suse_SAPHana(7) for details on all supported parameters and features.

IMPORTANT: The solution is not designed to manually 'migrate' the primary or
secondary instance using HAWK or any other cluster client commands. In the
_Administration_ section of this document we describe how to 'migrate' the primary
to the secondary site using {sap} and cluster commands.

== Supported scenarios and prerequisites

With the `SAPHanaSR` resource agent software package, we limit the support to
scale-up (single-box to single-box) system replication with the following
configurations and parameters:

* Two-node clusters are standard. Three node clusters are fine if you install
the resource agents also on that third node. But define in the cluster that
{HANA} resources must never run on that third node. In this case the third
node is an additional majority maker in case of cluster separation.
* The cluster must include a valid STONITH method.
** Any STONITH mechanism supported for production use by {sleha} {prodnr} (like
SBD, IPMI) is supported with SAPHanaSR.
** This guide is focusing on the SBD fencing method as this is hardware independent.
** If you use disk-based SBD as the fencing mechanism, you need one or more shared
drives. For productive environments, we recommend more than one SBD device. For
details on disk-based SBD, read the product documentation for {sleha} and the
manual pages sbd(8) and stonith_sbd(7).
** For diskless SBD, you need at least three cluster nodes. The diskless SBD
mechanism has the benefit that you do not need a shared drive for fencing.
Since diskless SBD is based on self-fencing, reliable detection of lost quorum
is absolutely crucial.
** Priority fencing is an optional improvement for two nodes, but does not work
for three nodes.
* Both nodes are in the same network segment (layer 2). Similar methods provided
by cloud environments such as overlay IP addresses and load balancer functionality
are also fine. Follow the cloud specific guides to set up your {sles4sap} cluster.
* Technical users and groups, such as _{refsidadm}_ are defined
locally in the Linux system. If that is not possible, additional measures are needed to ensure reliable
resolution of users, groups and permissions at any time. This might include caching.
* Name resolution of the cluster nodes and the virtual IP address must be done
locally on all cluster nodes. If that is not possible, additional measures are
needed to ensure reliable resolution of host names at any time.
* Time synchronization between the cluster nodes, such as NTP, is required.
* Both {HANA} instances of the system replication pair (primary and secondary)
have the same SAP Identifier (SID) and instance number.
* If the cluster nodes are installed in different data centers or data center
areas, the environment must match the requirements of the {sleha} cluster product.
Of particular concern are the network latency and recommended maximum distance
between the nodes. Review the product documentation for {sleha} about those
recommendations.
* Automated registration of a failed primary after takeover prerequisites need
to be defined.
** As a good starting configuration for projects, we recommend to switch off the automated
registration of a failed primary. The setup `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"` is set as
default. In this case, you need to register a failed primary after a takeover
manually. For re-registration, use precisely the site names that are already known
by the cluster. Use {SAP} tools like {HANA} cockpit or _hdbnsutil_.
** For optimal automation, we recommend to set `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`.
* Automated start of {HANA} instances during system boot must be
switched off.
* Multi-tenancy (MDC) databases are supported.
** Multi-tenancy databases can be used in combination with any other setup
(performance-optimized, cost-optimized, multi-tier, multi-target and read-enabled).
** In MDC configurations, the {HANA} RDBMS is treated as a single system including
all database containers. Therefore cluster takeover decisions are based on the
complete RDBMS status independent of the status of individual database containers.
** Tests on Multi-tenancy databases can force a different test procedure if you
are using strong separation of the tenants.
As an example, killing the complete {HANA} instance using _HDB kill_ does not work,
because the tenants are running with different Linux user UIDs.
_{refsidadm}_ is not allowed to terminate the processes of the other tenant users.
////
// TODO PRIO1: remove HANA 1.0?
// ** For {HANA} 1.0 you need version SPS10 rev3, SPS11 or newer if you want to stop
// tenants during production and you want the cluster to be able to take over.
// Older {HANA} versions are marking the system replication as failed if
// you stop a tenant.
////
* Only one system replication between the two {HANA} database in the Linux
cluster.  Maximum one system replication to an {HANA} database outside the Linux
cluster.
** Once an {HANA} system replication site is known to the Linux cluster, that exact
site name needs to be used whenever the site is registered manually.
** If a third {HANA} site is connected by system replication, that {HANA} is not
controlled by another Linux cluster. If that third site should work as part of a
fall-back HA cluster in DR case, that HA cluster needs to be in standby.
** The replication mode is either sync or syncmem for the controlled replication.
Replication mode async is not supported. The operation modes delta_datashipping,
logreplay and logreplay_readaccess are supported.
** See also the dedicated section on requirements for SAPHanaSR.py.
* For scale-up, the current resource agent supports {HANA} in system replication
beginning with {HANA} version 1.0 SPS 7 patch level 70, recommended is SPS 11. With
{HANA} 2.0 SPS04 and later multi-target system replication is possible as well. Even
in {HANA} multi-target environments, the current resource agent manages only two sites.
Thus only two {HANA} sites are part of the Linux cluster.
* Besides {HANA} you need {SAP} hostagent installed and started on your system.
For SystemV style, the sapinit script needs to be active.
////
// TODO PRIO1: publish the below, once SAP ships systemd integration for {HANA}
// For systemd style, the
// services saphostagent and SAP<SID>_<INO> can stay enabled. The systemd enabled
// saphostagent and instance´s sapstartsrv is supported from SAPHanaSR 0.155 onwards.
// Refer to the OS documentation for the systemd version. Refer to {SAP}
// documentation for the {HANA} version. Combining systemd style hostagent with
// SystemV style instance is allowed. However, all nodes in one Linux cluster need to
// use the same style.
////
* The RA's monitoring operations need to be active.
* Using HA/DR provider hook for srConnectionChanged() by enabling SAPHanaSR.py is
strongly  recommended for all scenarios. This might become mandatory in future versions.
** Using SAPHanaSR.py is yet already mandatory for multi-tier and multi-target replication.
** The Linux cluster needs to be up and running to allow HA/DR provider events being
written into CIB attributes. The current HANA SR status might differ from CIB srHook
attribute after cluster maintenance.
// TODO PRIO2: update above sentence, once we ship pick-up e.g. 0.155
* RA and srHook runtime almost completely depends on call-outs to controlled
resources, OS and Linux cluster. The infrastructure needs to allow these call-outs
to return in time.
* Colocation constraints between the SAPHanaController or SAPHana RA and other
resources are allowed only if they do not affect the RA's scoring. The location
scoring finally depends on system replication status and must not be overruled by
additional constraints. Thus it is not allowed to define rules forcing a SAPHanaController
or SAPHana master to follow another resource.
* Reliable access to the /hana/shared/ file system is crucial for {HANA} and the
Linux cluster.
* {HANA} feature Secondary Time Travel is not supported.
* The {HANA} Fast Restart feature on RAM-tmfps and {HANA} on persistent
memory can be used, as long as they are transparent to Linux HA.

// TODO PRIO3: align with manual pages SAPHanaSR(7) and SAPHanaSR.py(7)
// TODO PRIO2: remove HANA 1.0?
////
You need at least {SAPHanaSR} version {sapHanaSrMinVers} and in best {sles4sap} {prodnr}
{prodsp} or newer. {HANA} 1.0 is supported since SPS09 (095) for all mentioned setups.
{HANA} 2.0 is supported with all known SPS versions.
////

For the HA/DR provider hook scripts SAPHanaSR.py and susTkOver.py, the following
requirements apply:

* {HANA} 2.0 SPS04 or later provides the HA/DR provider hook method
srConnectionChanegd() with multi-target aware parameters. {HANA} 1.0 does not
provide them. The multi-target aware parameters are needed for the SAPHanaSR
scale-up package.
* {HANA} 2.0 SPS04 or later provides the HA/DR provider hook method preTakeover().
// TODO PRIO1: check above version
* The user _{refsidadm}_ needs execution permission as user root for the command
crm_attribute.
* The hook provider needs to be added to the {HANA} global configuration, in memory
and on disk (in persistence).


For the HA/DR provider hook script susChkSrv.py, the following requirements apply:

* {HANA} 2.0 SPS05 or later provides the HA/DR provider hook method srServiceStateChanged()
with needed parameters.
* No other HA/DR provider hook script should be configured for the srServiceStateChanged()
method. Hook scripts for other methods, provided in SAPHanaSR can be used in
parallel to susChkSrv.py, if not documented contradictingly.
* The user {refsidadm} needs execution permission as user root for the command
SAPHanaSR-hookHelper.
* The hook provider needs to be added to the {HANA} global configuration, in
memory and on disk (in persistence).
* The hook script runs in the {HANA} name server. It runs on the node where the
event srServiceStateChanged() occurs.
* If susChkSrv.py parameter action_on_lost=stop is set and the RA SAPHana
parameter AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true is set, it depends on HANA to release all OS
resources prior to the registering attempt.
* If the hook provider should be pre-compiled, the particular Python version that
comes with {HANA} needs to be used.

See also manual pages SAPHanaSR(7), SAPHanaSR.py(7), susTkOver.py(7) and
susChkSrv.py(7) for more details and requirements.

IMPORTANT: Without a valid STONITH method, the complete cluster is unsupported
and will not work properly.

If you need to implement a different scenario, we strongly recommend to define
a Proof of Concept (PoC) with {SUSE}. This PoC will focus on testing the existing
solution in your scenario. Most of the above mentioned limitations are set
because careful testing is needed.


[[cha.hana-sr.scope]]
== Scope of this document

This document describes how to set up the cluster to control {HANA} in
System Replication scenarios. The document focuses on the steps to integrate
an already installed and working {HANA} with System Replication.
In this document {sles4sap} {prodNr} {prodSP} is used. This concept can also be
used with {sles4sap} {prodNr} SP1 or newer.

The described example setup builds an {HANA} HA cluster in two data centers in
{saplocation1} ({sapsite1}) and in {saplocation2} ({sapsite2}), installed on two
{sles4sapa} {prodnr} {prodsp} systems.

.Cluster with {HANA} SR - performance optimized
image::hana_sr_scaleup_perfopt.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]

You can either set up the cluster using the YaST wizard, doing it manually or
using your own automation.

If you prefer to use the YaST wizard, you can use the shortcut _yast sap_ha_ to
start the module. The procedure to set up {saphanasr} using YaST is described in
the product documentation of {sles4sap} in section _Setting Up an {HANA} Cluster_
at {sles4sapGuide15}cha-cluster.html.

This guide focuses on the manual setup of the cluster to explain the details and
to give you the possibility to create your own automation.

The seven main setup steps are:

Planning the installation is essential for a successful {HANA} cluster setup.

Before you start, you need the following:

- Software from {SUSE}: {sles4sap} installation media, a valid subscription, and
access to update channels
- Software from {SAP}: {HANA} installation media
- Physical or virtual systems including disks
- Filled parameter sheet (see below <<parameter-sheet>>)


=== Minimum lab requirements and prerequisites

NOTE: The minimum lab requirements mentioned here are by no means SAP sizing
information. These data are provided only to rebuild the described cluster in a
lab for test purposes.
Even for tests the requirements can increase, depending on your test scenario.
For productive systems ask your hardware vendor or use the official SAP sizing
tools and services.

NOTE: Refer to {HANA} TDI documentation for allowed storage
configuration and file systems.

Requirements with 1 SAP system replication instance per site (1 : 1) - without
a majority maker (2 node cluster):

- 2 VMs with each 32GB RAM, 50GB disk space for the system
- 1 shared disk for SBD with 10 MB disk space
- 2 data disks (one per site) with a capacity of each 96GB for {HANA}
- 1 additional IP address for takeover
- 1 optional IP address for the read-enabled setup
- 1 optional IP address for HAWK Administration GUI

Requirements with 1 SAP instance per site (1 : 1) - with a
majority maker (3 node cluster):

- 1 optional IP address for HAWK Administration GUI

// pools size is calculated like:
//     shared = 1 * MEM
//     data   = NODES * 1   * MEM
//     log    =  NODES * 1/2 * MEM
//     pool = shared + data + log

=== Parameter sheet

[[parameter-sheet]]
Even if the setup of the cluster organizing two {HANA} sites is quite simple,
the installation should be planned properly. You should have all needed parameters
like SID, IP addresses and much more in place. It is good practice to first fill
out the parameter sheet and then begin with the installation.

This section contains information you should consider during the installation of
the operating system.

For the scope of this document, first {sles4sap} is installed and configured.
Then the {HANA} database including the system replication is set up. Finally
the automation with the cluster is set up and configured.

=== Installing {sles4sap}

Multiple installation guides already exist, for different purposes and with
different reasons to set up the server in a certain way. Below it is outlined
where this information can be found. In addition, you will find important details
you should consider to get a well-working system in place.

==== Installing the base operating system

Depending on your infrastructure and the hardware used, you need to adapt the
installation. All supported installation methods and minimum requirement are
described in the _Deployment Guide_ for {SLES} ({deploymentGuide15}).
In case of automated installations you can find further information in the
_AutoYaST Guide_ ({autoYastGuide15}). The main installation guides for {sles4sap}
that fit all requirements for {HANA} are available from the SAP notes:

// SUSE and SAP are kept literal here not by the reference, because its a quote of an external title
* {sapnote15} SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15: Installation Note
* {sapnoteset15} SAP HANA DB: Recommended OS settings for SLES 15 / SLES for SAP Applications 15

// TODO PRIO2: refer to saptune

==== Installing additional software
With {sles4sap}, {SUSE} delivers special resource agents for {HANA}. With the
pattern _sap-hana_, the resource agent for {HANA} *scale-up* is installed. For
the *scale-out* scenario you need a special resource agent. Follow the instructions
below on each node if you have installed the systems based on SAP note {sapnote15}.
The pattern _High Availability_ summarizes all tools recommended to be installed on
*all* nodes, including the _majority maker_.

.Installing additional software for the HA cluster

Optionally, the packages supportutils-plugin-ha-sap and ClusterTools2 can be
installed. The first helps collecting data for support requests, the second
simplifies common administrative tasks.

For more information, see section _Installation and Basic Setup_ of the {uarr}
{sleha} guide.

Even though this document focuses on the integration of an installed {HANA} with
system replication already set up into the Linux cluster, this chapter summarizes
the test environment. Always use the official documentation from {SAP} to install
{HANA} and to set up the system replication.

.Procedure

. Install the {HANA} databases.

. Check if the {SAP} hostagent is installed on all cluster nodes.
If this SAP service is not installed, install it now.

. Verify that both databases are up and running.

=== Installing the {HANA} databases

* Read the SAP Installation and Setup Manuals available at the SAP Marketplace.

* Download the {HANA} Software from SAP Marketplace.

* Install the {HANA} database as described in the {HANA} Server Installation Guide.
The {HANA} database client will be installed together with the server by default.

// TODO PRIO1: publish the below, once SAP ships systemd integration for HANA
// begin systemd style

=== Checking if the SAP hostagent is installed on all cluster nodes

Check if the native `systemd`-enabled SAP hostagent and instance `sapstartsrv`
are installed on all cluster nodes. If not, install and enable them now.

As Linux user _root_, use the command `systemctl` and `systemd-cgls` to check
the SAP hostagent and instance services:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# systemctl list-unit-files | grep sap
saphostagent.service enabled
sapinit.service generated
saprouter.service disabled
saptune.service enabled
----
The mandatory `saphostagent` service is enabled. This is the installation default.
Some more {sap} related services might be enabled, e.g. the recommended `saptune`.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# systemctl list-unit-files | grep SAP
SAP{sapsid}_{sapino}.service enabled
----
The instance service is indeed enabled, as required.

== {stepHSR}

image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase4.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

For more information read the section _Setting Up System Replication_ of the
{HANA} Administration Guide.

**Procedure**

. Back up the primary database.
. Enable primary database.
. Register and start the secondary database.
. Verify the system replication.

=== Backing up the primary database

Back up the primary database as described in the {HANA} Administration Guide,
section _{HANA} Database Backup and Recovery_. We provide an example with SQL
commands. You need to adapt these backup commands to match your backup infrastructure.

.Simple backup for the system database and all tenants with one single backup call
=========================
As user _{refsidadm}_ enter the following command:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
~> hdbsql -u SYSTEM -d SYSTEMDB -i {sapino} \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR FULL SYSTEM USING FILE ('backup')"
----

You will get a command output similar to the following:

----
0 rows affected (overall time 15.352069 sec; server time 15.347745 sec)
----
=========================

.Simple backup for a single container (non MDC) database
=========================
Enter the following command as user _{refsidadm}_:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbsql -i {refInst} -u <dbuser> \
   "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('backup')"
----
=========================

IMPORTANT: Without a valid backup, you can not bring {HANA} into a system
replication configuration.

=== Enabling the primary node

As Linux user _{refsidadm}_, enable the system replication at the primary node. You
need to define a site name (like {sapsite1}). This site name must be unique for
all {HANA} databases which are connected via system replication. This means the
secondary must have a different site name. The site names must not be changed
later when the cluster has been activated.

NOTE: Do not use strings like "primary" and "secondary" as site names.

.Enable the Primary
==========
Enable the primary using the `-sr_enable` option.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name={sapsite1}
checking local nameserver:
checking for active nameserver ...
nameserver is running, proceeding ...
configuring ini files ...
successfully enabled system as primary site ...
done.
----
==========

.Check SR Configuration on the Primary
==========
// the command output is still valid as of HANA 2.0 SPS5
Check the primary using the command `hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration`.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration --sapcontrol=1
SAPCONTROL-OK: <begin>
mode=primary
site id=1
site name={sapsite1}
SAPCONTROL-OK: <end>
done.
----
==========

The mode has changed from “none” to “primary”. The site now has a site name and a site ID.

=== Registering the secondary node

The {HANA} database instance on the secondary side must be stopped
before the instance can be registered for the system replication. You
can use your preferred method to stop the instance (like `HDB` or
`sapcontrol`). After the database instance has been stopped
successfully, you can register the instance using `hdbnsutil`. Again,
use the Linux user _{refsidadm}_:

.Stop the Secondary
==========
To stop the secondary, you can use the command line tool _HDB_.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode2}:~> HDB stop
----
==========

.Copy the KEY and KEY-DATA file from the primary to the secondary site
==========
Beginning with {HANA} 2.0, the system replication is running encrypted.
The key files need to be copied-over from the primary to the secondary site.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> cd /usr/sap/{refSID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs
~> rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/data/SSFS_{refSID}.DAT
~> rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/key/SSFS_{refSID}.KEY
----
==========

.Register the Secondary
==========
The registration of the secondary is triggered by calling _hdbnsutil -sr_register ..._.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
...
{sapnode2}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_register --name={sapsite2} \
     --remoteHost={sapnode1} --remoteInstance={sapino} \
     --replicationMode=sync --operationMode=logreplay
adding site ...
checking for inactive nameserver ...
nameserver {sapnode2}:30001 not responding.
collecting information ...
updating local ini files ...
done.
----
==========

The _remoteHost_ is the primary node in our case, the _remoteInstance_ is the
database instance number (here {sapino}).

Now start the database instance again and verify the system replication status.
On the secondary node, the mode should be one of "SYNC" or "SYNCMEM". "ASYNC" is
*not supported with automated cluster takeover*. The mode depends on the
*replicationMode* option defined during the registration of the secondary.

.Start Secondary and Check SR Configuration
==========
To start the new secondary, use the command line tool _HDB_. Then check the
SR configuration using `hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration`.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode2}:~> HDB start
...
{sapnode2}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration --sapcontrol=1
SAPCONTROL-OK: <begin>
mode=sync
site id=2
site name={sapsite2}
active primary site=1
primary masters={sapnode1}
SAPCONTROL-OK: <end>
done.
----
==========

To view the replication state of the whole {HANA} cluster, use the
following command as _{refsidadm}_ user on the primary node:

.Checking System Replication Status Details
==========
The python script _systemReplicationStatus.py_ provides details about the current
system replication.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py --sapcontrol=1
...
site/2/SITE_NAME={sapsite2}
site/2/SOURCE_SITE_ID=1
site/2/REPLICATION_MODE=SYNC
site/2/REPLICATION_STATUS=ACTIVE
overall_replication_status=ACTIVE
site/1/REPLICATION_MODE=PRIMARY
site/1/SITE_NAME={sapsite1}
local_site_id=1
...
----
==========

=== Manually testing the {HANA} SR takeover
[[cha.s4s.testtakeover]]

Before you integrate your {HANA} system replication into the HA cluster, it is
mandatory to do a manual takeover. Testing without the cluster helps to make
sure that basic operation (takeover and registration) is working as expected.

* Stop {HANA} on node 1

* Takeover {HANA} to node 2

* Register node 1 as secondary

* Start {HANA} on node 1

* Wait until sync state is active

=== Optional: Manually re-establishing {HANA} SR to original state

Bring the systems back to the original state:

* Stop {HANA} on node 2

* Take over {HANA} to node 1

* Register node 2 as secondary

* Start {HANA} on node2

* Wait until sync state is active

[[cha.s4s.hana-hook]]
== {stepHook}

image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase5.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

This step is mandatory to inform the cluster immediately if the secondary gets
out of sync. The hook is called by {HANA} using the HA/DR provider interface
in point-of-time when the secondary gets out of sync. This is typically the case
when the first commit pending is released. The hook is called by {HANA} again
when the system replication is back. This HA/DR provider method is
`srConnectionChanged()`, the related {SUSE} hook script is `SAPHanaSR.py`.
The hook script SAPHanaSR.py is defacto mandatory.

Another hook is called by {HANA} before an SR takeover is processed. This
method can be used to block a manual takeover during normal cluster operation.
This HA/DR provider method is `preTakeover()`, the related {SUSE} hook script is
`susTkOver.py`.

A third hook is called by {HANA} when a service status changes. This method
can be used to speed up the takeover in case the indexserver process fails.
This HA/DR provider method is `srServiceStateChanged()`, the related {SUSE} hook
script is `susChkSrv.py`.

**Procedure**

. Implement the python hook script SAPHanaSR.py on both sites.
. Implement the python hook script susTkOver.py on both sites.
. Implement the python hook script susChkSrv.py on both sites.
. Configure the system replication operation mode.
. Allow _{refsidadm}_ to access the cluster.
. Start {HANA}.
. Test the hook integration.

// TODO PRIO2: Steps "Start" and "Test" are incomplete

This will implement three {HANA} HA/DR provider hook scripts.
The hook script SAPHanaSR.py is needs no config parameters.
The configuration for susTkOver.py normally does not need to be adapted.
The default for parameter sustkover_timeout is set to 30 seconds and is good
for most environments.
The configuration shown for susChkSrv.py is a good starting point. Any tuning
should be aligned with the SAP experts.

NOTE: All hook scripts should be used directly from the SAPHanaSR package.
If the scripts are moved or copied, regular {SUSE} package updates will not work.

{HANA} must be stopped to change the global.ini and allow {HANA} to integrate
the HA/DR hook scripts during start. Alternatively, `SAPHanaSR-manageProvider`
might be used for adapting the global.ini. See manual page SAPHanaSR-manageProvider(8)
for details.


=== Implementing SAPHanaSR hook for srConnectionChanged

Use the hook from the SAPHanaSR package /usr/share/SAPHanaSR/SAPHanaSR.py.
The hook must be configured on all {HANA} cluster nodes.
In global.ini, the section `[ha_dr_provider_saphanasr]` needs to be created.
The section `[trace]` might be adapted.
Refer to the manual page SAPHanaSR.py(7) for details on this HA/DR provider hook
script, see also SAPHanaSR-manageProvider(8).

=== Implementing susTkOver hook for preTakeover

Use the hook from the SAPHanaSR package /usr/share/SAPHanaSR/susTkOver.py.
The hook must be configured on all {HANA} cluster nodes.
In global.ini, the section `[ha_dr_provider_sustkover]` needs to be created.
The section `[trace]` might be adapted.
Refer to the manual page susTkOver.py(7) for details on this HA/DR provider hook
script, see also SAPHanaSR-manageProvider(8).

=== Implementing susChkSrv hook for srServiceStateChanged

Use the hook from the SAPHanaSR package /usr/share/SAPHanaSR/susChkSrv.py.
The hook must be configured on all {HANA} cluster nodes.
In global.ini, the section `[ha_dr_provider_suschksrv]` needs to be created.
The section `[trace]` might be adapted.
Refer to the manual page susChkSrv.py(7) for details on this HA/DR provider hook
script, see also SAPHanaSR-manageProvider(8).

...
----
==========


=== Configuring system replication operation mode

When your system is connected as an {sapHanaSR} target, you can find an entry in the _global.ini_
which defines the operation mode. Up to now there are the following modes available:

* _delta_datashipping_
* _logreplay_
* _logreplay_readaccess_

Until a takeover and re-registration in the opposite direction, the entry for the
operation mode is missing on your primary site. The first operation mode which was
available was _delta_datashipping_. Today the preferred modes for HA are _logreplay_
or _logreplay_readaccess_. Using the operation mode _logreplay_ makes your secondary
site in the {HANA} system replication a hot standby system.
For more details regarding all operation modes, check the available SAP documentation
such as "How To Perform System Replication for SAP HANA ".

.Checking the Operation Mode
==========
Check both _global.ini_ files and add the operation mode if needed. Check the section
´system_replication´ for entry ´operation_mode = logreplay´.

Path for the _global.ini_: /hana/shared/<SID>/global/hdb/custom/config/
----
[system_replication]
operation_mode = logreplay
----
==========

=== Allowing {refsidadm} to access the cluster

The current version of the SAPHanaSR python hook uses the command `sudo` to allow
the _{refsidadm}_ user to access the cluster attributes.

//In Linux you can use `visudo`
//to start the vi editor for the _/etc/sudoers_ configuration file.

The user _{refsidadm}_ must be able to set the cluster attributes
hana_{refsidLC}_site_srHook_*. The {HANA} system replication hook needs
password free access. The following example limits the sudo access to exactly
setting the needed attribute.

Replace the {refsidLC} by the *lowercase* SAP system ID (like `{sapssid}`).

The entries can be added to a new file _/etc/sudoers.d/SAPHanaSR_ so that the
original _/etc/sudoers_ file does not need to be edited.

.Entry in sudo permissions /etc/sudoers.d/SAPHanaSR file
==========
Basic sudoers entry to allow {refsidadm} to use the hooks SAPHanaSR and susTkOver.

// command to be allowed used in the hook:
// "sudo /usr/sbin/crm_attribute -n hana_%s_site_srHook_%s -v %s -t crm_config -s SAPHanaSR"
// "sudo /usr/sbin/SAPHanaSR-hookHelper *"

This chapter describes the configuration of the cluster software {sleha}, which
is part of {sles4sap}, and the {HANA} database integration.

.Actions
. Basic cluster configuration

. Configuration of cluster properties and resources

. Testing the HA/DR provider hook integration

// TODO PRIO2: Describe the hook test (for example restart secondary) to trigger the write of cluster attributes

=== Configuring the basic cluster

The first step is to set up the basic cluster framework. For convenience, use YaST
or the {slehainit} script. It is strongly recommended to add a second corosync ring,
change it to UCAST communication and adjust the timeout values to fit your environment.

==== Setting up watchdog for "storage-based fencing"

// TODO PRIO2: Should we add some more information here?

If you use the storage-based fencing (SBD) mechanism (diskless or disk-based),
you must also configure a watchdog. The watchdog is needed to reset a node if
the system can not longer access the SBD (diskless or disk-based).
It is mandatory to configure the Linux system for loading a watchdog driver.
It is strongly recommended to use a watchdog with hardware assistance (as is
available on most modern systems), such as hpwdt, iTCO_wdt, or others. As fallback,
you can use the softdog module.

.Setup for Watchdog
====
IMPORTANT: Access to the watchdog timer:
No other software must access the watchdog timer; it can only be accessed by one
process at any time. Some hardware vendors ship systems management software that
use the watchdog for system resets (for example HP ASR daemon). Such software must
be disabled if the watchdog is to be used by SBD.

Determine the right watchdog module. Alternatively, you can find a list of installed
drivers with your kernel version.

----
# ls -l /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/watchdog
----

Check if any watchdog module is already loaded.

----
# lsmod | egrep "(wd|dog|i6|iT|ibm)"
----

If you get a result, the system has already a loaded watchdog. If the watchdog
does not match your watchdog device, you need to unload the module.

To safely unload the module, check first if an application is using the watchdog device.

----
# lsof /dev/watchdog
# rmmod <wrong_module>
----

Enable your watchdog module and make it persistent. For the example below, _softdog_
has been used. However, _softdog_ has some restrictions and should not be used as
first option.

----
# echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
# systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
----

Check if the watchdog module is loaded correctly.

----
# lsmod | grep dog
# ls -l /dev/watchdog
----

Testing the watchdog can be done with a simple action. Ensure to switch of your {HANA}
first because the watchdog will force an unclean reset or shutdown of your system.

In case a hardware watchdog is used, a desired action is predefined after the timeout of the watchdog has
reached. If your watchdog module is loaded and not controlled by any other application, do the following:

// TODO PRIO2: It seems a command is missing here??

IMPORTANT: Triggering the watchdog without continuously updating the watchdog
resets/switches off the system. This is the intended mechanism. The following
commands will force your system to be reset/switched off.

In case the softdog module is used, the following action can be performed:

----
# sync; cat /dev/watchdog & while date; do sleep 10; done
----
// # touch /dev/watchdog
// # echo 1 > /dev/watchdog

After your test was successful, you must implement the watchdog on all cluster members.

====

==== Setting up the initial cluster using `{slehainit}`

For more detailed information about setting up a cluster, refer to the sections
_Setting Up the First Node_ and _Adding the Second Node_ of the {dochaquickstart}
for {sleha} {pn15} {psp15} at {haquickstart15}.

This setup uses unicast (UCAST) for corosync communication (_-u_ option). Refer
to the {haAdminGuide15} on detailed explanations of the terms unicast/multicast.

Create an initial setup, using the `{slehainit}` command, and follow the
dialogs. Do this only on the first cluster node. Answer "no" to "Do you wish to
configure a virtual IP address" and to "Do you want to configure QDevice".

To use two corosync rings make sure you have two interfaces configured and run:

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # {slehainit} -u -M -s {sapsbd1} -s {sapsbd2}
----

To use only one corosync ring leave out the _-M_ option (not recommended):

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # {slehainit} -u -s {sapsbd1} -s {sapsbd2}
----

// TODO PRIO2: for disk less SBD: {slehainit} -u -S

This command configures the basic cluster framework including:

* SSH keys
* csync2 to transfer configuration files
* SBD (at least one device, in this guide two)
* corosync (at least one ring, better two rings)
* HAWK Web interface

IMPORTANT: As requested by `{slehainit}`, change the password of the user hacluster.

==== Checking and adapting the corosync and SBD configuration

//It is recommended to add a second corosync ring. If you did not start {slehainit}
//with the _-u_ option, you need to change corosync to use UCAST communication.
//To change to UCAST, stop the already running cluster by using `{clusterstop}`.
//After the setup of the corosync configuration and the SBD parameters, start the cluster again.
===== Checking the corosync configuration

Check the following blocks in the file _/etc/corosync/corosync.conf_.
The important parts are _udpu_ and the correct ring/IP configuration.

See also the example at the end of this document and refer to the manual pages
corosync.conf(5), votequorum(5) and corosync_overview(8) for details on parameters
and features.

===== Adapting the SBD configuration

// TODO PRIO2: Should we add some information about SBD timing tunables?

You can skip this section if you do not have any SBD devices, but be sure to
implement another supported fencing mechanism.

See the manual pages sbd(8) and stonith_sbd(7) for details.

.SBD Options in File /etc/sysconfig/SBD
[cols=",",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|SBD_WATCHDOG_DEV|
Define the watchdog device. It is mandatory to use a watchdog. SBD does not work
reliable without watchdog. Refer to the {slsa} manual and SUSE
TID 7016880 for setting up a watchdog.

|SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT|
// from the file /etc/sysconfig/SBD (2020-02-05)
Defines the timeout, in seconds, the watchdog will wait before panicking the node if no-one tickles it.

This parameter must match your storage environment. If you expect your storage could hang for 30s, then
this parameter must be set to a higher value. The typical setting of 5s could be to aggressive in
you production environment.

The parameter must also be aligned with the pacameker cluster property stonith-watchdog-timeout.
The property stonith-watchdog-timeout must be set >= the value of SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT.

// from the product documentation - copied 2020-02-05
If you set `stonith-watchdog-timeout` to a negative value, Pacemaker will automatically calculate this timeout and set it to twice the value of `SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT` starting with {sleha} {prodNr}.

|SBD_STARTMODE|
Start mode. If set to `clean`, sbd will only start if the node was
previously shut down cleanly or if the slot is empty.

|SBD_PACEMAKER|
Check Pacemaker quorum and node health.

|=======================================================================

In the following, replace {sapsbd1} and {sapsbd2} by your real sbd
device names. As an example the `SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT` is set to 15s to be less
aggressive than the formerly used 5s.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# egrep -v "(\^#|^$)"/etc/sysconfig/sbd
SBD_PACEMAKER=yes
SBD_STARTMODE="clean"
SBD_WATCHDOG_DEV="/dev/watchdog"
SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT="5"
SBD_TIMEOUT_ACTION="flush,reboot"
SBD_MOVE_TO_ROOT_CGROUP="auto"
SBD_OPTS=""
SBD_DEVICE="{sapsbd1};{sapsbd2}"
----

IMPORTANT: Also read the SUSE product documentation about calculation of timeouts for more details:
https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP1/single-html/SLE-HA-guide/#sec-ha-storage-protect-watchdog-timings

===== Verifying the SBD device

You can skip this section if you do not have any SBD devices, but make sure to
implement a supported fencing mechanism.

It is a good practice to check if the SBD device can be accessed from both nodes
and does contain valid records. Check this for all devices configured in
_/etc/sysconfig/sbd_. You can do so, for example, by calling `cs_show_sbd_devices`.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----

----

// TODO PRIO3: Check if we need to explain the timeout parameters of the sbd device (watchdog, allocate, loop, msgwait)

IMPORTANT: The timeout values in our example are only start values.
It is a requirement that they are tuned to your environment. Refer to the
TIDs 7011346 and 7023689 for more information.

To check the current SBD entries for the various cluster nodes, you can
use `sbd list`. If all entries are `clear`, no fencing task is marked in
the SBD device.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # sbd -d {sapsbd1} -d {sapsbd2} list
0     {sapnode1}      clear
0     {sapnode1}      clear
----

For more information on SBD configuration parameters, read the
section _Storage-based Fencing_, {uarr}SUSE Linux Enterprise High
Availability Extension and TIDs 7016880 and 7008216.

Now it is time to restart the cluster at the first node again (`{clusterstart}`).

==== Configuring the cluster on the second node

The second node of the two nodes cluster can be integrated by starting the command
`{slehajoin}`. This command asks for the IP address or name of the first cluster
node. With this command, all needed configuration files are copied over. As a result,
the cluster is started on both nodes.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# {slehajoin} -c {refHost1}
----

Press _RETURN_ to acknowledge the IP address.

==== Checking the cluster for the first time

Now it is time to check and optionally start the cluster for the first
time on both nodes.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # {clusterstatus}
{sapnode1}:~ # {sbdstatus}
{sapnode2}:~ # {clusterstatus}
{sapnode2}:~ # {sbdstatus}
{sapnode1}:~ # {clusterstart}
{sapnode2}:~ # {clusterstart}
----

Check the cluster status with crm_mon. We use the option "-r" to also
see resources, which are configured but stopped.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm_mon -r1
----

The command will show the "empty" cluster and will print something similar to the
screen output below. The most interesting pieces of information for now are that
there are two nodes in the status "online", the message "partition with quorum",
and a running SBD resource.

=== Configuring cluster properties and resources

This section describes how to configure constraints, resources, bootstrap, and STONITH,
using the `crm configure` shell command as described in section _Configuring and Managing Cluster Resources (Command Line)_
of the {uarr}SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension documentation.

Use the command `crm` to add the objects to the cluster information base (CIB). Copy the following
examples to a local file, edit the file and then load the configuration to the CIB:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # vi crm-fileXX
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-fileXX
----

==== Cluster bootstrap and more

The first example defines the cluster bootstrap options, the resource
and operation defaults. The stonith-timeout should be greater than 1.2
times the SBD on-disk msgwait timeout. The priority-fencing-delay should be
at least 2 times the SBD CIB pcmk_delay_max.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # vi crm-bs.txt
# enter the following to crm-bs.txt
property cib-bootstrap-options: \
    stonith-enabled="true" \
    stonith-action="reboot" \
    stonith-timeout="150" \
    priority-fencing-delay="30"
rsc_defaults rsc-options: \
    resource-stickiness="1000" \
    migration-threshold="5000"
op_defaults op-options: \
    timeout="600" \
    record-pending=true
----

Now add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-bs.txt
----

==== STONITH device

Skip this section if you are using diskless SBD.

The next configuration part defines an SBD disk STONITH resource.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-sbd.txt
# enter the following to crm-sbd.txt
primitive stonith-sbd stonith:external/sbd \
    params pcmk_delay_max="15"
----

Again we add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-sbd.txt
----

For fencing with IPMI/ILO see section <<Using IPMI as fencing mechanism>>.

==== Using IPMI as fencing mechanism

For details about IPMI/ILO fencing see our cluster product documentation ({haAdminGuide15}).
An example for an IPMI STONITH resource can be found in section <<Example for the IPMI STONITH method>>
of this document.

To use IPMI, the remote management boards must be compatible with the IPMI standard.

For the IPMI-based fencing, configure a primitive per-cluster
node. Each resource is responsible to fence exactly one cluster node.
Adapt the IP addresses and login user / password of the
remote management boards to the STONITH resource agent. We recommend to
create a special STONITH user instead of providing root access to the
management board. Location rules must guarantee that a host should never
run its own STONITH resource.

==== Using other fencing mechanisms

This section is only relevant if the recommended disk-based or diskless SBD fencing is not used.

We recommend to use SBD (best practice) or IPMI (second choice) as STONITH mechanism. The {sleha} product
also supports additional fencing mechanism not covered here.

For further information about fencing, read the Administration Guide for SUSE Linux Enterprise High
Availability Extension at {haAdminGuide15}. For public cloud environements, refer to your cloud provider's documentation on supported fencing mechanisms.

==== SAPHanaTopology

This step is to define the resources needed, to analyze the {HANA} topology for the replicated pair.
Prepare the changes in a text file, for example _crm-saphanatop.txt_, and load it with the command:

`crm configure load update crm-saphanatop.txt`

// TODO PRIO3: Discuss naming scheme SAPHanaTop SAPHanaCon vs old scheme

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-saphanatop.txt
# enter the following to crm-saphanatop.txt
primitive rsc_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} ocf:suse:SAPHanaTopology \
    op monitor interval="10" timeout="600" \
    op start interval="0" timeout="600" \
    op stop interval="0" timeout="300" \
    params SID="{sapsid}" InstanceNumber="{sapino}"
clone cln_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} rsc_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} \
    meta clone-node-max="1" interleave="true"
----

Additional information about all parameters can be found with the command:

`man ocf_suse_SAPHanaTopology`

Again, add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-saphanatop.txt
----

The most important parameters here are SID and InstanceNumber, which are
quite self explaining in the SAP context. Beside these parameters, typical
tuneables are the timeout values or the operations (start, monitor, stop).

==== SAPHana

This step is to define the resource needed, to control the replicated {HANA} pair.
Edit the changes in a text file, for example _crm-saphana.txt_, and load it with the following command:

`crm configure load update crm-saphana.txt`

.Typical Resource Agent parameter settings for different scenarios
[width="99%",cols="52%,16%,16%,16%",options="header",]

|AUTOMATED_REGISTER |false / true |false / true |false
|DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT |7200 |7200 |7200
|============================================================

// TODO PRIO1: Check if all parameters in special DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT
// are explained well

.Description of important Resource Agent parameters
[width="100%",cols="42%,58%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Parameter |Description
|PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER |Defines whether RA should prefer to take over to
the secondary instance instead of restarting the failed primary locally.

|AUTOMATED_REGISTER a|
Defines whether a former primary should be automatically registered to
be secondary of the new primary. With this parameter you can adapt the
level of system replication automation.

If set to `false`, the former primary must be manually registered. The
cluster will not start this SAP HANA RDBMS until it is registered, to avoid
double primary up situations.

|DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT |Time difference needed between two primary
time stamps if a dual-primary situation occurs. If the time difference
is less than the time gap, the cluster holds one or both instances
in a "WAITING" status. This is to give an administrator the chance to react on a
failover. If the complete node of the former primary crashed, the former
primary will be registered after the time difference is passed. If
"only" the SAP HANA RDBMS has crashed, the former primary will be
registered immediately. After this registration to the new primary, all
data will be overwritten by the system replication.
|=======================================================================

Additional information about all parameters of the SAPHana RA can be found with
the following command:

`man ocf_suse_SAPHana`

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-saphana.txt
# enter the following to crm-saphana.txt
primitive rsc_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} ocf:suse:SAPHana \
    op start interval="0" timeout="3600" \
    op stop interval="0" timeout="3600" \
    op promote interval="0" timeout="3600" \
    op monitor interval="60" role="Master" timeout="700" \
    op monitor interval="61" role="Slave" timeout="700" \
    params SID="{sapsid}" InstanceNumber="{sapino}" PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER="true" \
        DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT="7200" AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false" \
    meta priority="100"
ms msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} rsc_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} \
    meta clone-max="2" clone-node-max="1" interleave="true" maintenance=true
----

Now add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-saphana.txt
----

The most important parameters here are again SID and InstanceNumber.
Beside these parameters the timeout values for the operations (start,
promote, monitors, stop) are typical tuneables.

==== Adding a virtual IP address for the primary site

The last resource to be added for SAPHanaSR is covering the virtual IP address.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-vip.txt
# enter the following to crm-vip.txt

primitive rsc_ip_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \
    op monitor interval="10s" timeout="20s" \
    params ip="{sapip1srv1}"
----

Load the file to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-vip.txt
----

In most on-premise installations, only the parameter _ip_ needs to be set to the virtual IP address to be presented to the client systems.
Public cloud environments often need specific settings.

==== Constraints for SAPHanaSR

Two constraints are organizing the correct placement of the virtual IP
address for the client database access and the start order between the
two resource agents SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-cs.txt
# enter the following to crm-cs.txt
colocation col_saphana_ip_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} 2000: rsc_ip_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}:Started \
    msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}:Master
order ord_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} Optional: cln_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} \
    msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}
----

Load the file to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-cs.txt
----

==== Activating multi-state resource for cluster operation

The multi state resource was added to the cluster with in maintenance mode. To get the resource operated
by the cluster the maintenance must be ended by the command:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource refresh msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}
# cs_wait_for_idle -s 5
# crm resource maintenance msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} off
----

Remark: The command `cs_wait_for_idle` is part of the package `ClusterTools2`.

==== Active/active read-enabled scenario

This step is optional. If you have an active/active {HANA} system
replication with a read-enabled secondary, it is possible to integrate the
needed second virtual IP address into the cluster. This is been done by adding
a second virtual IP address resource and a location constraint binding the
address to the secondary site.

The lists of tests will be further enhanced in one of the next updates of this document.

As with any cluster testing is crucial. Make sure that all test
cases derived from customer expectations are implemented and passed
fully. Otherwise the project is likely to fail in production.

The test prerequisite, if not described differently, is always that both
nodes are booted, normal members of the cluster and the HANA RDBMS is
running. The system replication is in sync (SOK).


=== Test cases for semi-automation

In the following test descriptions we assume
`PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER="true"` and `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false".`

NOTE: The following tests are designed to be run in sequence and depend
on the exit state of the proceeding tests.

==== Test: Stop primary database on site A (node 1)

[[cha.hana-sr.administrate]]
== Administration

=== Dos and don'ts

In your project, you should:

* Define STONITH before adding other resources to the cluster.
* Do intensive testing.
* Tune the timeouts of operations of SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology.
* Start with the parameter values PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER=”true”, AUTOMATED_REGISTER=”false” and
DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT=”7200”.
* Always wait for pending cluster actions to finish before doing something.
* Set up a test cluster for testing configuration changes and administrative
procedure before applying them on the production cluster.

In your project, avoid:

* Rapidly changing/changing back a cluster configuration, such as setting
nodes to standby and online again or stopping/starting the multi-state
resource.
* Creating a cluster without proper time synchronization or unstable name
resolutions for hosts, users and groups.
* Using site names other than the ones already known by the cluster when
manually re-registering a site.
* Adding location rules for the clone, multi-state or IP resource. Only location
rules mentioned in this setup guide are allowed. For public cloud refer to the
cloud specific documentation.
* Using {SAP} tools for attempting start/stop/takeover actions on a database
while the cluster is in charge of managing that database.

IMPORTANT: As "migrating" or "moving" resources in crm-shell, HAWK or other
tools would add client-prefer location rules, support is limited to maintenance
procedures described in this document. See <<cluster-tests>> and
<<sec-maintenance>> for proven procedures.

=== Monitoring and tools

You can use the High Availability Web Console (HAWK), {HANA} Cockpit, {HANA} Studio and different
command line tools for cluster status requests.

==== HAWK – cluster status and more

You can use a Web browser to check the cluster status.

.Cluster Status in HAWK
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUp-HAWK-Status-SLE12.png[scaledwidth=100%]
// TODO PRIO3: SAPHanaSR-ScaleUp-HAWK-Status-SLE15.png

If you set up the cluster using {slehainit} and you have installed all packages
as described above, your system will provide a very useful Web interface. You
can use this graphical Web interface to get an overview of the complete cluster
status, perform administrative tasks or configure resources and cluster bootstrap
parameters. Read the product manuals for a complete documentation of this user
interface. For the {HANA} system replication {usecase} scenario the use of HAWK
should follow the guidance given in this guide.

==== {HANA} Cockpit

Database-specific administration and checks can be done with {HANA} Cockpit.
Before trying start/stop/takeover for the database, make sure the cluster is not
in charge of managing the respective resource. See also <<sec-maintenance>>.

// DONE PRIO1: We need a HANA Cockpit screen-shot here

image::saphana-cockpit01.png[scaledwidth=100%]

==== Cluster command line tools

A simple overview can be obtained by calling `crm_mon`. Using option
`-r` shows also stopped but already configured resources. Option `-1`
tells `crm_mon` to output the status once instead of periodically.

==== SAPHanaSR command line tools

To show some SAPHana or SAPHanaTopology resource agent internal
values, you can call the program `SAPHanaSR-showAttr`. The internal
values, the storage location and their parameter names may change in the next
versions. The command `SAPHanaSR-showAttr` will always fetch the values
from the correct storage location.

Do not use cluster commands like `crm_attribute` to fetch the values
directly from the cluster. If you use such commands, your methods will be
broken when you need to move an attribute to a different storage place
or even out of the cluster. At first _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ is a test
program only and should not be used for automated system monitoring.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]

 {sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-showAttr
 Host \ Attr clone_state remoteHost roles       ... site    srmode sync_state ...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------

 {sapnode2}      DEMOTED     {sapnode1}     4:S:master1:... {sapsite2}      sync  SOK        ...
----

`SAPHanaSR-showAttr` also supports other output formats such as *script*. The script
format is intended to allow running filters. The SAPHanaSR package beginning with
version 0.153 also provides a filter engine `SAPHanaSR-filter`. In combination of
`SAPHanaSR-showAttr` with output format script and `SAPHanaSR-filter` you can define
effective queries:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-showAttr --format=script | \
   SAPHanaSR-filter --search='remote'
Thu Feb  6 12:28:10 2020; Hosts/{sapnode1}/remoteHost={sapnode2}
Thu Feb  6 12:28:10 2020; Hosts/{sapnode2}/remoteHost={sapnode1}
----

`SAPHanaSR-replay-archive` can help to analyze the SAPHanaSR attribute values from
`hb_report` (`crm_report`) archives. This allows post mortem analyzes.

In our example, the administrator killed the primary {HANA} instance using the command
`HDB kill-9`. This happened around 9:10 pm.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # hb_report -f 19:00
INFO: {sapnode1}# The report is saved in ./hb_report-1-11-11-2019.tar.bz2
INFO: {sapnode1}# Report timespan: 11/11/19 19:00:00 - 11/11/19 21:05:33
INFO: {sapnode1}# Thank you for taking time to create this report.
{sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-replay-archive --format=script \
    ./hb_report-1-11-11-2019.tar.bz2 | \
    SAPHanaSR-filter --search='roles' --filterDouble
Mon Nov 11 20:38:01 2019; Hosts/{sapnode1}/roles=4:P:master1:master:worker:master
Mon Nov 11 20:38:01 2019; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=4:S:master1:master:worker:master
Mon Nov 11 21:11:37 2019; Hosts/{sapnode1}/roles=1:P:master1::worker:
Mon Nov 11 21:12:43 2019; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=4:P:master1:master:worker:master
----

In the above example the attributes indicate that at the beginning {sapnode1}
was running primary (4:P) and {sapnode2} was running secondary (4:S).

At 21:11 (CET) suddenly the primary on {sapnode1} died - it was falling down to 1:P.

The cluster did jump-in and initiated a takeover. At 21:12 (CET) the former secondary
was detected as new running master (changing from 4:S to 4:P).


==== {HANA} LandscapeHostConfiguration

To check the status of an SAPHana database and to find out if the
cluster should react, you can use the script *landscapeHostConfiguration.py*
to be called as Linux user _{refsidadm}_.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~> HDBSettings.sh landscapeHostConfiguration.py
| Host   | Host   | ... NameServer   | NameServer  | IndexServer | IndexServer |
|        | Active | ... Config Role  | Actual Role | Config Role | Actual Role |
| ------ | ------ | ... ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| {sapnode1} | yes    | ... master 1     | master      | worker      | master      |

overall host status: ok
----

Following the SAP HA guideline, the SAPHana resource agent interprets the return
codes in the following way:

.Interpretation of Return Codes
[width="100%",cols="15%,85%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Return Code |Interpretation
|4 |{HANA} database is up and OK. The cluster does interpret this as a
correctly running database.

|3 |{HANA} database is up and in status info. The cluster does
interpret this as a correctly running database.

|2 |{HANA} database is up and in status warning. The cluster does
interpret this as a correctly running database.

|1 |{HANA} database is down. If the database should be up and is not
down by intention, this could trigger a takeover.

|0 |Internal Script Error – to be ignored.
|=======================================================================

=== Maintenance

[[sec-maintenance]]

To receive updates for the operating system or the {sleha},
it is recommended to register your systems to either a local {suma}, to {rmtool} ({rmt}),
or remotely with {scc}.
For more information, visit the respective Web pages:
{sumalandingpage}
{rmtGuide15}
{sccfaq}
Examples for maintenance tasks are also given in manual page SAPHanaSR_maintenance_examples(7).

==== Updating the operating system and cluster

For an update of {sles4sap} packages including cluster software, follow the
rolling update procedure defined in the product documentation
of the {sleha} Administration Guide, chapter _Upgrading Your Cluster and Updating Software Packages_ at
{haAdminGuide15}#cha-ha-migration.

==== Updating {HANA} - seamless {HANA} maintenance

For updating {HANA} database systems in system replication, you need to follow
the defined SAP processes. This section describes the steps required before and
after the update procedure to get the system replication automated again.

{SUSE} has optimized the {HANA} maintenance process in the cluster.
The improved procedure only sets the multi-state resource to maintenance and
keeps the rest of the cluster (SAPHanaTopology clones and IPaddr2 vIP resource)
still active. Using the updated procedure allows a seamless {HANA} maintenance
in the cluster, as the virtual IP address can automatically follow the running
primary.

// TODO: PRIO2 HINT for new wizard?!?!?!

Prepare the cluster not to react on the maintenance work to be done on
the {HANA} database systems. Set the multi-state resource to `maintenance`.

.Main {HANA} Update procedure
==============================
Pre-Update Tasks:: For the multi-state-resource set the maintenance mode as follows:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource>
----
+
The <multi-state-resource> in the guide at hand is `msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}`.

Update:: Process the {SAP} Update for both {HANA} database systems. This
procedure is described by {SAP}.

Post-Update Tasks:: Expect the primary/secondary roles to be exchanged after the
maintenance. Therefore, tell the cluster to forget about these states and to
reprobe the updated {HANA} database systems.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource refresh <multi-state-resource>
----
+
After the {HANA} update is complete on both sites, tell the cluster about the
end of the maintenance process. This allows the cluster to actively control and
monitor the {sap} again.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource> off
----

==============================

==== Migrating an {HANA} primary

In the following procedures, we assume the primary runs on node 1 and the secondary
on node 2. The goal is to "exchange" the roles of the nodes: the primary should
then run on node 2 and the secondary should run on node 1.

There are different methods to get the exchange of the roles done. The
following procedure shows how to tell the cluster to "accept" a role change via
native {HANA} commands.

// TODO PRIO2: Check for takeover with handshake

.Migrating an {HANA} primary using {SAP} toolset
==============================
Pre-Migration Tasks:: Set the multi-state resource to `maintenance`. This can be done on any
cluster node.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource-name>
----

// TODO PRIO2: Check -sr_takeover with 'handshake'

Manual Takeover Process::
* Stop the primary {HANA} database system. Enter the command in our
example on node1 as user _{refsidadm}_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> HDB stop
----
+
* Before proceeding, make sure the primary {HANA} database is stopped.
* Start the takeover process on the secondary {HANA} database system.
Enter the command in our example on node 2 as user _{refsidadm}_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_takeover
----
+
* Register the former primary to become the new secondary. Enter the
command in our example on node1 as user _{refsidadm}_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost={sapnode2} --remoteInstance={sapino} \
 --replicationMode=sync --name={sapsite1} \
 --operationMode=logreplay
----
+
* Start the new secondary {HANA} database system. Enter the command in
our example on node1 as user _{refsidadm}_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> HDB start
----

Post-Migration Tasks::
* Wait some time until `SAPHanaSR-showAttr` shows both {HANA} database
systems to be up again (field roles must start with the digit 4). The new
secondary should have role "S" (for secondary).
+
* Tell the cluster to forget about the former multi-state roles and to
re-monitor the failed master. The command can be submitted on any
cluster node as user root.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource refresh multi-state-resource-name
----
+
* Set the multi-state resource to the status managed again. The command
can be submitted on any cluster node as user root.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource-name> off
----
==============================

The following paragraphs explain how to use the cluster to partially automate the
migration. For the described attribute query using `SAPHanaSR-showAttr` and
`SAPHanaSR-filter` you need at least `SAPHanaSR` with package version 0.153.

.Moving an {HANA} primary using the Cluster Toolset
==============================
* Create a "move away" from this node rule by using the *force* option.
+
[subs="attributes,specialchars,quotes"]
----
# crm resource move <multi-state-resource-name> *force*
----
+
Because of the "move away" (*force*) rule, the cluster will *stop* the
current primary. After that, run a *promote* on the secondary site if the system
replication was in sync before. You should not migrate the primary if
the status of the system replication is not in sync (SFAIL).
+
IMPORTANT: Migration without the *force* option will cause a takeover without the
former primary to be stopped. Only the migration with *force* option is supported.
+
NOTE: The crm resource command *move* was previously named *migrate*. The *migrate*
command is still valid but already known as obsolete.

* Wait until the secondary has completely taken over to be the new primary role. You
  see this using the command line tool `SAPHanaSR-showAttr`. Now check for the
  attributes "roles" for the new primary. It must start with "*4:P*".
+

Mon Jun 21 19:38:50 2021; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=*4:P*:master1:master:worker:master
----

* If you have set up the parameter value `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`, you can skip this step. In
other cases you now need to register the old primary. Enter the command
in our example on node1 as user _{refsidadm}_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost={sapnode2} --remoteInstance={sapino} \

+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource clear <multi-state-resource-name>
----
+
NOTE: The crm resource command *clear* was previously named *unmigrate*. The *unmigrate*
command is still valid but already known as obsolete.

* Wait until the new secondary has started. You
  see this using the command line tool `SAPHanaSR-showAttr` and check for the
  attributes "roles" for the new primary. It must start with "*4:S*".

==============================

////
* Set the primary node to be standby.

`crm node standby {sapnode1}`

The cluster will stop the primary {HANA} database and, if the system
replication was in sync, process the takeover on the secondary site.

Wait until the former secondary has completely taken over to be the new
primary.

If you have set up `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`, you can skip this step. In
other cases you now need to register the old primary. Enter the command
in our example on node1 as user _{refsidadm}_.

`hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost={sapnode2} --remoteInstance={sapino} --replicationMode=sync --name={sapsite1} --operationMode=logreplay`

Set the standby node to be online again.
