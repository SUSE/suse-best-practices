= Using SUSE Automation to Deploy an SAP HANA Cluster: Getting Started

== About the guide

This document will walk you through the deployment of a simple two-node SAP HANA HA Cluster using the SUSE Automation Project.
This project uses Terraform and Salt to deploy and configure the operating system, SAP software and High Availability (HA) Cluster.
If extensive configuration and customization are required, refer to the project documentation at https://github.com/SUSE/ha-sap-terraform-deployments

For simplicity, this guide uses the Cloud Shell to perform the deployment,
as it provides easy access to most of the required tooling.

It is possible to easily use a local Linux or macOS computer, but some of the commands may need modification or omission.

The architecture for the deployment is similar to the below.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
image::TRD_SLES-SAP-HA-automation-quickstart-cloud-aws-automation-architecture.jpg[width=470]
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]

The project will perform the following:

* Deploy infrastructure - including VPC, subnets, IAM roles etc.
* Deploy instances -  2 x SAP HANA instances
* Configure the operating system for the SAP workload
* Run the SAP HANA installation
* Configure SAP HANA System Replication (HSR)
* Configure SUSE High Availability cluster components and resources


== Configuring the Cloud Shell

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
Start an AWS Cloud Shell from the AWS Services menu.

When the shell has launched, the next step is to configure the CLI and provide API access keys to allow the creation of AWS resources and infrastructure.
The API Keys are created from the AWS console. For more details, refer to
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html

The quickest way to configure the AWS CLI is by running the command:

----
aws configure
----

This is described in the documentation linked above.

The command generates a file in `$HOME/.aws/credentials` which is referenced later.

IMPORTANT: The user specified in this step needs certain AWS permissions to ensure the deployment is successful.

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]


== Ensuring Terraform is installed

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
Terraform is already deployed as part of the Azure Cloud Shell.

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

Terraform is not currently deployed as part of the AWS Cloud Shell, in this step Terraform is downloaded and installed to the `~/bin` directory.
Update the command below with the latest version of Terraform as needed.
As Terraform is updated on a regular basis, it may be necessary to update after installation, or specify a different version to download.

From the `~` directory, run:

----
mkdir ~/bin
cd ~/bin
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.7/terraform_0.14.7_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.14.7_linux_amd64.zip
cd ~
----

Check Terraform is working by running:

----
terraform --version
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]


== Preparing the SAP media

The SAP Media needs to be made available so it can be accessed during the deployment.
The SUSE Automation project allows for three methods for presenting the SAP media:

a. SAR file and SAPCAR executable (SAP HANA Database only)
b. Multipart exe/RAR files
c. Extracted media

This guide recommends the simplest method which is the multipart exe/RAR files.

With the correct entitlement, SAP media can be downloaded from the SAP Web site at
https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/software-downloads.html

The versions listed below are for illustration. When downloading the multipart files for SAP HANA, use your required version.

----
51053381_part1.exe
51053381_part2.rar
51053381_part3.rar
51053381_part4.rar
----


ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
For AWS, an S3 bucket is used.

Using the AWS Console, perform the following actions:

* Create an S3 bucket. (The example shows a bucket called mysapmedia, but a unique name should be used.)
* Create a folder within the bucket.
* Upload the SAP media to the folder in the S3 bucket.

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]



== Downloading and configuring the SUSE Automation code

The SUSE Automation code is published in GitHub. The following command will clone the project to the Cloud Shell ready for configuration.


ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

----
cd ~
git clone --depth 1 --branch 7.0.0 https://github.com/SUSE/ha-sap-terraform-deployments
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]


Next, generate SSH keys to allow for inter-cluster communication between the provisioned nodes.
If SSH keys already exist, the next step can be skipped.

----
#optional if ssh-keys already exist
ssh-keygen -t rsa -N ''
----

=== Configuring the deployment options and modifying the Terraform variables

The files that need to be configured are contained in a subdirectory of the project. Use that as the working directory.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

----
cd ~/ha-sap-terraform-deployments/aws
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]


A template is provided.  For a demo environment this will need around 10 parameters modifying.
Copy the Terraform example file to `terraform.tfvars`.

----
cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
----

Edit `terraform.tfvars` and modify as explained below.
If you are duplicating the lines before modification, ensure the original is commented out, or the deployment will fail.

Firstly, choose the region for the deployment.


ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

----
# Region where to deploy the configuration
aws_region = "eu-central-1"
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]

This setting provides Terraform the credentials to deploy the infrastructure on the cloud.


ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

With this parameter, Terraform will use the AWS credentials file created above. It is the simplest way to provide credentials for the deployment.

----
aws_credentials = "~/.aws/credentials"
----

If not used, ensure the following lines are commented out or the deployment will fail.

----
#aws_access_key_id = my-access-key-id
#aws_secret_access_key = my-secret-access-key
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]

The following parameters select the version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications to deploy, and where to deploy from.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

For simplicity, the 'os_owner' is set to use PAYG instances from the AWS Marketplace. If an existing SUSE subscription needs to be used, this section can be changed to use BYOS images. Refer to the project documentation.

----
os_image = "suse-sles-sap-15-sp1"
os_owner = "679593333241"
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]

Next, enter the path for the public and private SSH keys that were generated earlier.

----
# SSH Public key location to configure access to the remote instances
public_key_location = "/path/to/your/public/ssh/key"

# Private SSH Key location
private_key_location = "/path/to/your/private/ssh/key"
----

To keep the cluster architecture and deployment simple and to provide additional packages needed to deploy, uncomment and set the following parameters:

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

----
ha_sap_deployment_repo = "https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:ha-clustering:sap-deployments:v7"
...
pre_deployment = true
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]

Next, set some options for the HANA instances. The following selects the instance name and host name prefix for the deployment.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

----
hana_instancetype = "r3.8xlarge"
name = "hana"
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]


Modify the following to point to SAP media that was uploaded to the storage location.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

----
hana_inst_master = "s3://mysapmedia/SAPHANA"

hana_archive_file = "5105338_part1.exe"
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]

Finally, to ensure a fully automated deployment, it is possible to set passwords within the `terraform.tfvars` file.
If the parameters are not set in this file, they must be entered when running the deployment.

Uncomment and set the following:

----
hana_master_password = "YourPassword1234"
netweaver_master_password = "SuSE1234"
----

NOTE: All passwords must conform to SAP password policies or the deployment will fail.


Optional: If a monitoring instance is required as part of the deployment, find and uncomment the following:

----
monitoring_enabled = true
----


== Finalizing the Automation configuration

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

=== Subscribing to the AWS Marketplace offer

To automatically deploy instances from the AWS Marketplace, ensure to *Subscribe* to the offering.

A link for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications 15 SP2 can be found at link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/server/procurement?productId=e9701ac9-43ee-4dda-b944-17c6c231c8db[].

If a different version of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP Applications is required, subscribe to the relevant version on the marketplace.


== Configuring IAM policies

If the deployment is being run from the root user of the AWS account, or if the user specified when configuring the AWS CLI has
Admin privileges in your AWS account, you can skip this step.

If using an IAM user with limited permissions, additional IAM rights may be required as IAM policies are created and attached
during deployment, for example to access and manage EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM (to create roles and policies) and EFS storage.

There are two options available to achieve this:

a. Attach the *IAMFullAccess* policy to the user executing the project. However, this is not recommended.
b. The recommended method is to create a new IAM policy and attach it to the desired user.

TIP: Depending on your own IAM rights, you may need to reach out to an AWS administrator for your account to set this up for you.

Create the following policy and attach it to the IAM user running the deployment:

----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:TagRole",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "iam:DeleteRole",
                "iam:GetRolePolicy",
                "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
                "iam:ListInstanceProfilesForRole",
                "iam:CreateInstanceProfile",
                "iam:GetInstanceProfile",
                "iam:RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile",
                "iam:DeleteInstanceProfile",
                "iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]


== Deploying the project

When running the deployment, Terraform will create and name resources on AWS based on the 'workspace' in use.
It is highly recommended to create a unique workspace from which to run the deployment.

----
terraform init
terraform workspace new demo
terraform workspace select demo
terraform plan
terraform apply
----

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

TIP: The AWS Cloud Shell has a timeout of around 20 minutes and the shell will close if left
unattended, resulting in a failed deployment.  It is strongly advised to retain focus on the AWS Cloud Shell window to ensure the timeout does not occur.

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]

If successful, the output will be the public IP addresses for the cluster nodes.

image::TRD_SLES-SAP-HA-automation-quickstart-cloud-s3-bucket-aws-automation-complete.png[width=470]


== Tearing down

When finished with the deployment, or even if the deployment has failed, ensure that Terraform is used to tear down the environment.

----
terraform destroy
----

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
This method will ensure all AWS resource, such as instances, volumes, VPCs, and IAM roles, are cleaned up.
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP" ]
GCP
endif::[]
