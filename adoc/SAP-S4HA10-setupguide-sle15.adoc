== About this guide

The following sections focus on background information and the purpose of the document at hand.

=== Introduction

{sles4sapReg} is the optimal platform to
run {sapReg} applications with high availability. Together with a redundant layout
of the technical infrastructure, single points of failure can be eliminated.

{sapBSReg} is a sophisticated application platform for large enterprises
and mid-size companies. Many critical business environments require the highest
possible {sapReg} application availability.

The described cluster solution can be used for {sapReg} {sapS4pl}.

{sapS4pl} is a common stack of middleware functionality used to support SAP
business applications. The {sapERS} constitutes application
level redundancy for one of the most crucial components of the {sapS4pl} stack,
the enqueue service. An optimal effect of the enqueue replication mechanism can
be achieved when combining the application level redundancy with a high
availability cluster solution, as provided for example by {sles4sap}. Over several
years of productive operations, the components mentioned have proven their maturity
for customers of different sizes and industries.

The here described HA setup is based on cluster-controlled file systems for the
SAP central services working directories.
This setup with cluster-controlled file system resources has been used in former
HA certifications. It still is supported.
For deploying new HA clusters, we recommend using the so-called simple mount setup,
described in
"SAP S/4 HANA - Enqueue Replication 2 High Availability Cluster With Simple Mount - Setup Guide"
(https://documentation.suse.com/sbp/sap/html/SAP_S4HA10_SetupGuide_SimpleMount-SLE15).

== Scope of this document

The document at hand explains how to:

- Plan a {sleHA} platform for {sapS4pl}, including {sapERS}.
- Set up a {linux} high availability platform and perform a basic {sapS4pl}
  installation including {sapERS} on {sle}.
- Integrate the high availability cluster with the {sap} control framework via
  *{s4sClConnector3}* version 3, as certified by {sap}.

NOTE: This guide implements the cluster architecture for enqueue replication version 2. For {sapS4Pl}
 versions 1809 or newer enqueue replication version 2 is the default.

This guide focuses on the high availability of the central services. For {saphana} system replication
consult the guides for the performance-optimized or cost-optimized scenario (see <<sec.resource>>).

== Overview

This document describes setting up a pacemaker cluster using {sles4sap}
{slesProdVersion} for the Enqueue Replication scenario. The focus is on matching the {sapCert}
certification specifications and goals. For the setup described in this document, two nodes are used for the ASCS
central services instance and ERS replicated enqueue instance. These two nodes are controlled by
the SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability cluster. A third node is used for running the database and PAS and AAS application
server instances. An additional fourth node is used as NFS server.

The goals for the setup include:

- Integration of the cluster with the native systemd based {SAP} start framework
  _sapstartsrv_ to ensure that maintenance procedures do not break the cluster stability
- Rolling Kernel Switch (RKS) awareness
- Standard {sap} installation to improve support processes
- Support of automated HA maintenance mode for SAP resources by implementing support of
  SAP HACheckMaintenanceMode and HASetMaintenanceMode
- Support of more than two cluster nodes for ASCS and ERS instances allowed

The updated certification {sapcert} redefines some of the test procedures
and describes new expectations how the cluster should behave in special
conditions. These changes allowed to improve the cluster architecture and to
design it for easier usage and setup.

Shared SAP resources are located on a central NFS server.

The {sap} instances themselves are installed on a shared disk to allow for switching over the file
systems for proper functionality. A shared disk setup also allows using the SBD
for the cluster fencing mechanism STONITH.

=== Differences to previous cluster architectures

- The described concept differs from the old stack that used a multi-state architecture.
  With the new certification there is a switch to a simpler model with primitives.
  This means: on one machine there is the ASCS instance with its own resources and on
  the other machine there is the ERS instance with its own resources.
- For {s4Hana} the new concept implies that, after a resource failure, the ASCS does not need to be started at the ERS
  side. The new enqueue architecture is also named ENSA2.
- Use of native systemd integration for {sap} hostagent and instanceÂ´s sapstartsrv.
  Refer to the {sap} documentation for the neccessary  product version. See also SAP Note 3139184.
  SUSE *systemd* version 234 at least is needed. For details refer to the {sles4sap} product documentation.
  SUSE resource agents are needed; at least *sapstartsrv-resource-agents 0.9.1* and *resource-agents 4.x* from November 2021.

=== Three systems or more for ASCS, ERS, database and additional SAP instances

This document describes the installation of a distributed {sap} system on three and more
systems. In this setup, only two systems reside inside the cluster. The database and
{sap} dialog instances can be added to the cluster either by adding more nodes to the
cluster or by installing the database on either of the existing nodes. However, it is recommended to install the
database on a separate cluster. The cluster configuration for three and more nodes is described at the
end of this document. The number of nodes within one cluster should be either two or an odd number.
// TODO PRIO3 : check text content
NOTE: Because the setup at hand focuses on the {sapCert} certification, the cluster detailed
in this guide only manages the {sap} instances ASCS and ERS.

If your database is {sapHana}, we recommend setting up the performance-optimized
system replication scenario using the automation solution {sapHanaSR}. The
{sapHanaSR} automation should be set up in an own two-node cluster. The setup is
described in a separate best practices document available from the SUSE Best Practices Web page.

**    Hostname:   {myVipNDSec}



=== High availability for the database

Depending on your needs, you can increase the availability of the database, if your
database is not already highly available by design.

==== {SapHana} system replication

A perfect enhancement of the three-node scenario described in this document is
to implement an {saphana} system replication (SR) automation.

.One cluster for central services, one for {saphana} SR
image::sles4sap_nw740_cs+hanasr.svg[SVG]

////
TODO PRIO3: this could be skipped
The following databases are supported in combination with this scenario:

- SAP HANA DATABASE 2.0

==== Simple stack

Another option is to implement a second cluster for a database without SR, also known as
"ANYDB". The cluster resource agent SAPDatabase uses the SAPHOSTAGENT to control
and monitor the database.

.One cluster for the central services and one cluster for the ANY database
image::sles4sap_nw740_cs+anydb.svg[SVG]
////

.The following OS/database combinations are examples for this scenario
[width="85%",options="header"]
|=========================================================
2+^|{sles4sap} {slesProdVersion}
^| *Intel X86_64*
|SAP HANA DATABASE 2.0

NOTE: Version for {sapS4pl} on Linux on AMD64/Intel 64. More information about
the supported combinations of OS and databases for {sapS4in} can be found at the
SAP Product Availability Matrix at https://apps.support.sap.com/sap/support/pam[SAP PAM].

=== Integration of {sapS4} into the cluster using the Cluster Connector

The integration of the HA cluster through the SAP control framework using the
*{s4sClConnector}* is of special interest. The service *{SAPSTARTSRV}* controls {sap} instances since
{sap} Kernel versions 6.40. One of the classic problems running
{sap} instances in a highly available environment is the following: If an {sap}
administrator changes the status (start/stop) of an {sap} instance without using
the interfaces provided by the cluster software, the cluster framework will
detect that as an error status and will bring the {sap} instance into the old
status by either starting or stopping the {sap} instance. This can result in
very dangerous situations, if the cluster changes the status of an {sap} instance
during some {sap} maintenance tasks. The new updated solution enables the central component
*{SAPSTARTSRV}* to report state changes to the cluster software. This avoids dangerous situations
as previously described.
More details can be found in the blog article "Using sap_vendor_cluster_connector for interaction between cluster
framework and sapstartsrv" at https://blogs.sap.com/2014/05/08/using-sapvendorclusterconnector-for-interaction-between-cluster-framework-and-sapstartsrv/comment-page-1/.

NOTE: If you update from an {sapS4Pl} version less than 1809, read SAP Note 2641019 carefully to adapt your cluster.

.Cluster connector to integrate the cluster with the {sap} start framework
image::sles4sap_clusterconnector.svg[SVG]

NOTE: For this scenario, an updated version of the *{s4sClConnector3}* is used.
It implements the API version 3 for the communication between the cluster
framework and the *{sapstartsrv}* service.

The new version of the *{s4sClConnector3}* allows starting, stopping and migrating
an {sap} instance. The integration between the cluster software and the
*{sapstartsrv}* also implements the option to run checks of the HA setup using either the
command line tool *sapcontrol* or even the {SAP} management consoles ({SAP} MMC or
{sap} MC). Since version 3.1.0 and later the maintenance mode of cluster resources triggered with SAP
*sapcontrol* commands is supported. See also manual page sap_suse_cluster_connector(8).


=== Disks and partitions

XFS is used for all {sap} file systems besides the file systems on NFS.

==== Shared disk for cluster ASCS and ERS

The disk for the ASCS and ERS instances must be shared and assigned to the
cluster nodes {my2nd1} and {my2nd2} in the two-node cluster example. In addition to the partitions for the file systems
for the SAP instances, the disk also provides the partition to be used as SBD.

On {my2nd1} prepare the file systems for the shared disk. Create three partitions on
the shared drive {myDevA}:

* Partition one ({myDevPartSbd}) for SBD (7 MB)
* Partition two ({myDevPartAscs}) for the first file system (10 GB) formatted with XFS
* Partition three ({myDevPartErs}) for the second file system (10 GB) formatted with XFS

To create the partitions, you can use either YaST or available command line tools.
The following script can be used for non-interactive setups.

.Create Partitions and File Systems for SBD and ASCS/ERS on {my2nd1}
========
[subs="attributes"]

# parted -s {myDevA} print
# # we are on the 'correct' drive, right?
# parted -s {myDevA} mklabel gpt

# parted -s {myDevA} mkpart primary 10.7G 21.5G
# mkfs.xfs {myDevPartAscs}
# mkfs.xfs {myDevPartErs}
----
========

For these file systems, we recommend using normal partitions to keep the cluster
configuration as simple as possible. However, you can also place these file
systems in separate volume groups. In that case, you need to add further cluster
resources to control the logical volume groups, and occasionally
MD-Raid devices. The description of such a setup however is out of the scope of this guide.

After having partitioned the shared disk on {my2nd1}, you need to request a
partition table rescan on {my2nd2}.

[subs="attributes"]
----
# partprobe; fdisk -l {myDevA}
----

During the SAP installation you need to mount {myMpAscs} on {my2nd1} and
{myMpErs} on {my2nd2}.
////

////
- {my2nd1}:   {myDevPartAscs}   {myMpAscs}
- {my2nd2}:   {myDevPartErs}   {myMpErs}

==== Disk for database and dialog instances (HANA DB)

The disk for the database server is assigned to {myNode1}.
The disk for the primary and secondary application server is assigned to
{myNode1}.

.{myNode1}
* Partition one ({myDevPartDb}) for the database (160 GB) formatted with XFS
* Partition two ({myDevPartPas}) for the PAS instance (10 GB) formatted with XFS
* Partition three ({myDevPartSec}) for the AAS instance (10 GB) formatted
with XFS

=== Mount points and NFS shares

In the present setup the directory _/usr/sap_ is part of the root file system. You can
also create a dedicated file system for that area and mount _/usr/sap_
during the system boot. As _/usr/sap_ contains the {sap} control file
_sapservices_ and the *{saphostagent}*, the directory should not be placed on a
shared file system between the cluster nodes.

You need to create the directory structure on all nodes that should run the SAP resource.
The SYS directory will be located on an NFS share for all nodes.

- Create mount points and mounting NFS shares on all nodes.

# mount -t nfs {myNfsSrv}:{myNFSSys} /usr/sap/{mySid}/SYS
# mount -t nfs {myNfsSrv}:{myNFSSapmedia} /var/lib/Landscape
----
Mount options may depend on your particular environment.

# mount {myDevPartSec} {myMPSec}
----
////
TODO PRIO3: one partition will be mounted mkdir must be run again after mount
////
You do not control the NFS shares via the cluster in the setup at hand. Thus you should
add these file systems to _/etc/fstab_ to get the file systems mounted during
the next system boot.

({my2nd1}) is used to install the ASCS {sap} instances. Server 3
({my2nd2}) is used to install the ERS {sap} instances.

- Mount the instance and database file systems on one specific node:

(Dialog {myNode1}) # mount {myDevPartPas} /usr/sap/{mySid}/{myInstDSec}
----
=============================================================

- As a result, the directory _/usr/sap/{mySid}/_ should now look as follows:

[subs="attributes"]

drwxr-xr-x 5 {mySidLc}adm sapsys 87 28. Mar 17:21 SYS/
----

NOTE: The owner of the directory and files is changed during the {sap} installation. By default, all
of them are owned by _root_.

== SAP installation

The overall procedure to install the distributed SAP system is as follows:

.Tasks

. Plan Linux user and group number scheme
. Install the ASCS instance for the central services
. Install the ERS to get a replicated enqueue scenario
. Prepare the ASCS and ERS installations for the cluster take-over
. Install the database
. Install the primary application server instance (PAS)
. Install additional application server instances (AAS)

The result will be a distributed {sap} installation as illustrated here:

.Distributed installation of the {sap} system
image::sles4sap_nw740_distInstall.svg[SVG]

=== Linux user and group number scheme

Whenever asked by the SAP software provisioning manager (SWPM) which Linux User
IDs or Group IDs to use, refer to the following table as an example:

[subs="attributes"]
----
Group sapinst      1001
Group sapsys       1002
Group {bsSidDBLc}shm       1003

User  {mysapadm}       2001
User  sapadm       2002
User  {bsDBadm}       2003
----


=== Installing ASCS on {my2nd1}

Temporarily, as the local IP address, set the service IP address which you will later use in the
cluster, because the installer needs to be able to resolve and use it.
Make sure to use the correct virtual host name for each installation step.
If applicable, make sure to also mount file systems like _{myDevPartAscs}_ and _/var/lib/Landscape/_.

[subs="attributes"]
----
# ip a a {myVipAAscs}{myVipNM} dev eth0
# mount {myDevPartAscs} {myMpAscs}
# cd {mySAPinst}
# ./sapinst SAPINST_USE_HOSTNAME={myVipNAscs}
----

* SWPM product installation path:
** Installing {sapS4in}  -> SAP HANA DATABASE -> Installation -> Application Server ABAP
-> High-Availability System -> ASCS Instance
* Use SID {mySid}
* Use instance number {myAscsIno}
* Deselect using FQDN
* All passwords: use {mySapPwd}
* Double-check during the parameter review, if virtual name *{myVipNAscs}* is used
* If you get an error during the installation about permissions, change the
  ownership of the ASCS directory

[subs="attributes"]
----
# chown -R {mysapadm}:sapsys /usr/sap/{mySid}/{myInstAscs}
----

=== Installing ERS on {my2nd2}

Temporarily, as the local IP address, set the service IP address which you will later use in the
cluster, because the installer needs to be able to resolve and use it.
Make sure to use the correct virtual host name for each installation step.

[subs="attributes"]
----
# ip a a {myVipAErs}{myVipNM} dev eth0
# mount {myDevPartErs} {myMpErs}
# cd {mySAPinst}
# ./sapinst SAPINST_USE_HOSTNAME={myVipNErs}
----

* SWPM product installation path:
** Installing {sapS4in}  -> SAP HANA DATABASE -> Installation -> Application Server ABAP ->
High-Availability System -> ERS Instance
* Use instance number {myErsIno}
* Deselect using FQDN
* Double-check during the parameter review that virtual name *{myVipNErs}* is used
* If you get an error during the installation about permissions, change the
  ownership of the ERS directory

[subs="attributes"]
----
# chown -R {mysapadm}:sapsys /usr/sap/{mySid}/{myInstErs}
----

* If you get a prompt to manually stop/start the ASCS instance, log in to
{my2nd1} as user {mysapadm} and call 'sapcontrol'.

[subs="attributes"]
----
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function Stop    # to stop the ASCS
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function Start   # to start the ASCS
----

=== Subsequent steps for ASCS and ERS

After installation, you can perform several subsequent steps on the ASCS and ERS instances.

==== Stopping ASCS and ERS

To stop the ASCS and ERS instances, use the commands below.
On _{my2nd1}_, do the following:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# su - {mySapAdm}
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function Stop
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function StopService
----

On _{my2nd2}_, do the following:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# su - {mySapAdm}
# sapcontrol -nr {myErsIno} -function Stop
# sapcontrol -nr {myErsIno} -function StopService
----

==== Disabling *systemd* services of the ASCS and the ERS {sap} instance

This is mandatory for giving control over the instance to the HA cluster.
See also manual pages ocf_suse_SAPStartSrv(7) and SAPStartSrv_basic_Cluster(7).

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# systemctl disable SAP{mySid}_{myAscsIno}.service
# systemctl stop SAP{mySid}_{myAscsIno}.service
# systemctl disable SAP{mySid}_{myErsIno}.service
# systemctl stop SAP{mySid}_{myErsIno}.service
----
NOTE: Stopping this instance services will stop the SAP instance as well.
Starting the instance services will not start the SAP instances.

- Check the {sap} systemd integration:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# systemctl list-unit-files | grep SAP
SAP{mySid}_{myErsIno}.service disabled
SAP{mySid}_{myErsIno}.service disabled
----
The instance services are indeed disabled, as required.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# systemctl list-unit-files | grep sap
saphostagent.service enabled
sapinit.service generated
saprouter.service disabled
saptune.service enabled
----
The mandatory `saphostagent` service is enabled. This is the installation default.
Some more {sap} related services might be enabled, for example the recommended `saptune`.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# cat /usr/sap/sapservices
systemctl --no-ask-password start SAP{mySid}_{myAscsIno} # sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/{mySid}/SYS/profile/{mySid}_{myInstAscs}_{myVipNAscs}
systemctl --no-ask-password start SAP{mySid}_{myErsIno} # sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/{mySid}/SYS/profile/{mySid}_{myInstErs}_{myVipNErs}
----
The _sapservices_ file is still there for compatibility. It shows native systemd commands, one per
line for each registered instance.
You will find a SystemV style example in the appendix.
// TODO PRIO3: link to example


==== Integrating the cluster framework using _{s4sClConnector3}_

Install the package *{s4sClConnector3}* version 3.1.0 from the SUSE
repositories:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# zypper in {s4sClConnector3}
----

NOTE: The package *{s4sClConnector3}* contains the version 3.x.x (SAP API 3).
The package *{s4sClConnector3}* with version 3.0.x implements the SUSE SAP API
version 3. New features like SAP Rolling Kernel Switch (RKS) and migration of ASCS are
only supported with this new version.
The package *{s4sClConnector3}* with version 3.1.x supports in addition the maintenance mode of
cluster resources triggered from SAP tools.

For the ERS and ASCS instances, edit the instance profiles
{mySid}_{myInstAscs}_{myVipNAscs} and {mySid}_{myInstErs}_{myVipNErs} in the
profile directory _/usr/sap/{mySid}/SYS/profile/_.

Tell the *{sapStartSrv}* service to load the HA script connector library and
to use the connector *{s4sClConnector3}*. On the other hand, please make sure
the feature _Autostart_ is *not* used.

==== Adapting {sap} profiles to match the {sapCert} certification

For the ASCS instance, change the start command from _Restart_Program_xx_ to
_Start_Program_xx_ for the enqueue server (Enqueue Server 2). This change tells the
{sap} start framework *not* to self-restart the enqueue process. Such a restart
would result in a loss of the locks.

[subs="attributes"]
----
Start_Program_01 = local $(_ENQ) pf=$(_PF)
----

Optionally, you can limit the number of restarts of services (in the case of
ASCS, this limits the restart of the message server).

For the ERS instance, change the start command from _Restart_Program_xx_ to
_Start_Program_xx_ for the enqueue replication server (Enqueue Replicator 2).

== Implementing the cluster

The main procedure to implement the cluster is as follows:

.Tasks

. OS preparation and install the cluster software
. Configure the cluster base including corosync and resource manager
. Configure the cluster resources
. Tune the cluster timing in special for the SBD.

///////////////////////////////
TODO PRIO3: Do we really need to stop, unconfigure and unmount?
Maybe we find a way to configure the resources that the cluster just
accepts the already started resource groups - lets see ;-)
///////////////////////////////

NOTE: Before you continue to set up the cluster, perform the following actions:
First stop all SAP instances. Then remove the (manually added) IP addresses on the cluster nodes.
Finally unmount the file systems which will be controlled by the cluster later.

NOTE: The SBD device/partition needs to be created beforehand. Double-check which
device/partition to use! In this setup guide a partition _{myDevPartSbd}_
is already reserved for SBD usage.

=== Preparing the operating system  and installing the cluster softwaren

- Set up and enable *chrony* with *YaST*.

- Install the RPM pattern *ha_sles* on both cluster nodes.
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
# zypper in -t pattern ha_sles
----

=== Configuring the cluster base

.Tasks

- To configure the cluster base, you can use either YaST or the interactive
command line tool *ha-cluster-init*. The example below uses the command line wizard.

- Install and configure the watchdog device on the first machine.

Instead of deploying the software based solution, a hardware-based watchdog device should preferably be used.
The following example uses the software device but can be easily adapted to the hardware device.

[subs="attributes"]
----
# modprobe softdog
# echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
# systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
# lsmod | egrep "(wd|dog|i6|iT|ibm)"
----

- Install and configure the cluster stack on the first machine

[subs="attributes"]
----
# ha-cluster-init -u -s  {myDevPartSbd}
----

- Join the second node

On the second node, perform some preparation steps.

[subs="attributes"]
----
# modprobe softdog
# echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
# systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
# lsmod | egrep "(wd|dog|i6|iT|ibm)"
----

To configure the cluster base, you can use either YaST or the interactive
command line tool *ha-cluster-join*. The example below uses the command line wizard.

[subs="attributes"]
----
# ha-cluster-join -c {my2nd1}
----

- The _crm_mon -1r_ output should look as follows:

stonith-sbd	(stonith:external/sbd):	Started {my2nd1}
----

=== Configuring cluster resources

A changed SAPInstance resource configuration is needed for {sapS4} to *not* use
the multi-state construct anymore. Move to a more cluster-like construct to
start and stop the ASCS and the ERS instances themselves, but *not* the complete
multi-state resource.

////////////////////////////////////
TODO PRIO3: We need to adap this section, if the new enqueue2 is published.
////////////////////////////////////

With the new version of ENSA2, the ASCS instance can be started on the same host. There is no longer a need
to follow the ERS instance. The ASCS instance receives the enqueue lock table over the network from the ERS instance. If no
other node is available, the ASCS instance will be started on the same host where the ERS instance is running.

.Resources and constraints
image::sles4sap_s4hana1809_resources.svg[SVG]

////
The implementation is done using a new flag "runs_ers_$SID" within
the resource agent (RA), enabled using the resource parameter "IS_ERS=TRUE".
////

Another benefit of this concept is that you can work with native (mountable)
file systems instead of a shared (NFS) file system for the {sap} instance
directories.

==== Preparing the cluster for adding the resources

To prevent the cluster from starting partially defined resources, set the cluster
to the maintenance mode. This deactivates all monitor actions.

As user _root_, type the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# crm configure property maintenance-mode="true"

Create a _txt_ file (like _crm_ascs.txt_) with your preferred text editor. Add
both examples (primitives and group) to that file and load the configuration to
the cluster manager configuration.

As user _root_, type the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# crm configure load update crm_ascs.txt
----

==== Configuring the resources for the ERS instance

Second, configure the resources for the file system, IP address and the {sap}
instance. You need to adapt the parameters for your specific environment.

The specific parameter _IS_ERS=true_ must only be set for the ERS instance.

==== Configuring the colocation constraints between ASCS and ERS

Compared to the ENSA1 configuration, the constraints between the ASCS and ERS instances are changed.
An ASCS instance should avoid starting up on the cluster node running the ERS instance if any other
node is available.  Today the ENSA2 setup can resynchronize the lock table over the network.

If the ASCS instance has been started by the cluster on the ERS node, the ERS instance should
be moved to another cluster node (col_sap_{mysid}_no_both). This constraint
is needed to ensure that the ERS instance will synchronize the locks again and the cluster is
ready for an additional take-over.

.Location constraint
================================================
[subs="attributes"]
----
colocation col_sap_{mysid}_no_both -5000: grp_{mySID}_{myInstErs} grp_{mySID}_{myInstAscs}

      rsc_sap_{mySID}_{myInstErs}:stop symmetrical=false
----
================================================

Create a _txt_ file (like _crm_col.txt_) with a text editor. Add
both constraints to that file and load the configuration to the
cluster manager configuration.

As user _root_, type the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# crm configure load update crm_col.txt
----

==== Activating the cluster

The last step is to end the cluster maintenance mode and to allow the
cluster to detect already running resources.

As user _root_, type the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# crm configure property maintenance-mode="false"
----

// TODO PRIO3: Subsection "tune cluster timeouts and sbd"


////
############################
#
# ADMINISTRATION
#TODO PRIO3: renaming Do and Don't to Operational Tasks
############################
////


== Administration

=== Dos and don'ts

NOTE: Before each test, verify that the cluster is in idle state, no migration constraints are active,
and no resource failure messages are visible. Start each procedure with a clean setup.
See also manual pages sap_suse_cluster_connector(8), cs_clusterstate(8), crm(8) and crm_mon(8).

==== Migrating the ASCS instance

To *migrate* the ASCS {sap} instance, you should use {sap} tools such as
the {sap} management console. This will trigger *{sapStartSrv}* to use the
{s4sClConnector3} to migrate the ASCS instance. As user _{mysapadm}_ you can run
the command below to migrate the ASCS. This will always
migrate the ASCS to the ERS side which will keep the {sap} enqueue locks.

As user _{mysapadm}_, type the command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function HAFailoverToNode ""
----

==== Never block resources

With {sapCert} it is *no longer allowed to block resources* from being
  controlled manually. This means using the variable _BLOCK_RESOURCES_ in
  _/etc/sap_suse_cluster_connector_ is not allowed anymore.

==== Always use unique instance numbers

Currently all {sap} *instance numbers controlled by the cluster must be unique*.
  If you need multiple dialog instances, such as D00, running on different
  systems, they should not be controlled by the cluster.

==== Setting the cluster to maintenance mode

The procedure to set the cluster into maintenance mode can be executed as user _root_ or _sidadm_.

As user _root_, type the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# crm configure property maintenance-mode="true"
----
See also manual page crm(8).
// TODO PRIO3: use resource maintenance instead of cluster maintenance

As user _{mysapadm}_, type the following command (the full path is needed):

[subs="attributes"]
----
# /usr/sbin/crm configure property maintenance-mode="true"
----

==== Stopping the cluster maintenance

The procedure to end the maintenance mode for the cluster can be executed as user _root_.
Type the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# crm configure property maintenance-mode="false"
----

==== Starting the resource maintenance mode

The procedure to start the resource maintenance mode can be executed as user _{mysapadm}_.
This sets the ASCS and ERS cluster resource to *unmanaged*.

As user _{mysapadm}_, type the command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function HASetMaintenanceMode 1
----

==== Stopping the Resource Maintenance Mode

The procedure to start the resource maintenance mode can be executed as user _{mysapadm}_.
This sets the ASCS and ERS cluster resource to *managed*.

As user _{mysapadm}_, type the command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function HASetMaintenanceMode 0
----

==== Cleaning up resources

You can also *clean-up resource failures*. Failures of the ASCS will be automatically
  deleted to allow a failback after the configured period of time. For all other
  resources, you can clean-up the status including the failures.

As user _root_, type the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# crm resource cleanup RESOURCE-NAME
----

=== Testing the cluster

It is strongly recommended to perform at least the following tests before you
go into production with your cluster:

==== Checking Product Names with HAGetFailoverConfig

Check if the name of the SUSE cluster solution is shown in the output of
  *sapcontrol* or the {sap} management console. This test checks the status of the
  {sapNW} cluster integration.

As user _{mysapadm}_, type the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function HAGetFailoverConfig
----

==== Running SAP checks using HACheckConfig and HACheckFailoverConfig

Check if the HA configuration tests are passed successfully and do not produce error messages.

As user _{mysapadm}_, type the following commands:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function HACheckConfig
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function HACheckFailoverConfig
----

==== Manually migrating ASCS

Check if manually migrating the ASCS instance using HA tools works properly.

As user _root_, run the following commands:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# crm resource migrate rsc_sap_{mySid}_{myInstAscs} force
## wait until the ASCS is been migrated to the ERS host
# crm resource unmigrate rsc_sap_{mySid}_{myInstAscs}
----

==== Migrating ASCS using HAFailoverToNode

Check if moving the ASCS instance using {sap} tools like {sapCtrl} works properly.

As user _{mysapadm}_, type the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function HAFailoverToNode ""
----

==== Testing ASCS migration after operating system failure

Check if the ASCS instance moves correctly after a node failure.
This test will immediately trigger a hard reboot of the node.

As user _root_, type the following command:

[subs="attributes"]
----
## on the ASCS host
# echo b >/proc/sysrq-trigger
----

==== Restarting ASCS in-place using _Stop_ and _Start_

Check if the in-place restart of the {sap} resources have been processed
  correctly. The {sap} instance should not failover to an other node, it
  must start on the same node where it has been stopped.

////
TODO PRIO3: Is the statement still valid? I guess no.
WARNING: This test will force the SAP system to *lose* the enqueue locks.
   *This test should not be processed during production.*
////
As user _{mysapadm}_, do the following:

[subs="attributes"]
----
## example for ASCS
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function Stop
## wait till the ASCS is completely down
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function Start
----

==== Automated restart of the ASCS instance (simulating rolling kernel switch)

The next test should proof that the cluster solution did nor interact neither try to restart the ASCS instance
during a maintenance procedure. In addition, it should verify that no locks are lost during the restart of
an ASCS instance during an RKS procedure. The cluster solution should recognize that the restart of
the ASCS instance was expected. No failure or error should be reported or counted.

Optionally, you can set locks and verify that they still exist after the maintenance procedure. There are multiple
ways to do that. One example test can be performed as follows:

. Log in to your SAP system and open the transaction SU01.
. Create a new user. Do not finish the transaction to see the locks.
. With the SAP MC / MMC, check if there are locks available.
. Open the ASCS instance entry and go to _Enqueue Locks_.
. With the transaction SM12, you can also see the locks.

Do this test multiple times in a short time frame. The restart of the ASCS instance in the example below happens five times.

As user _{mysapadm}_, create and execute the following script:
[subs="attributes"]
----
$ cat ascs_restart.sh
#!/bin/bash
for lo in 1 2 3 4 5; do
  echo LOOP "$lo - Restart ASCS{myAscsIno}"
  sapcontrol -host sap{mySidLc}as -nr {myAscsIno} -function StopWait 120 1
  sleep 1
  sapcontrol -host sap{mySidLc}as -nr {myAscsIno} -function StartWait 120 1
  sleep 1
done
----
[subs="attributes"]
----
$ bash ascs_restart.sh
----

==== Rolling kernel switch procedure

The rolling kernel switch (RKS) is an automated procedure that enables the kernel in an ABAP system
to be exchanged without any system downtime. During an RKS, all instances of the system, and
generally all SAP start services (sapstartsrv), are restarted.

. Check in SAP note 953653 whether the new kernel patch is RKS compatible to your currently running kernel.
. Check SAP note 2077934 - Rolling kernel switch in HA environments.
. Download the new kernel from the SAP service market place.
. Make a backup of your current central kernel directory.
. Extract the new kernel archive to the central kernel directory.
. Start the RKS via SAP MMC, system overview (transaction SM51) or via command line.
. Monitor and check the version of your SAP instances with the SAP MC / MMC or with *sapcontrol*.

As user _{mysapadm}_, type the following commands:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
## sapcontrol [-user <sidadm psw>] -host <host> -nr <INSTANCE_NR> -function UpdateSystem 120 300 1
# sapcontrol -user {mySapAdm} {mySapPwd} -host {myVipNAscs} -nr {myAscsIno} -function UpdateSystem 120 300 1
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function GetSystemUpdateList -host {myVipNAscs} \
  -user {mySapAdm} {mySapPwd}
# sapcontrol -nr {myAscsIno} -function GetVersionInfo -host {myVipNAscs} \
  -user {mySapAdm} {mySapPwd}
# sapcontrol -nr {myErsIno} -function GetVersionInfo -host {myVipNErs} \
  -user {mySapAdm} {mySapPwd}
# sapcontrol -nr {myPasIno} -function GetVersionInfo -host {myVipNPas} \
  -user {mySapAdm} {mySapPwd}
# sapcontrol -nr {myDSecIno} -function GetVersionInfo -host {myVipNDSec} \
  -user {mySapAdm} {mySapPwd}
----


==== Additional tests

In addition to the already performed tests, you should do the following:

* Check the recoverable and non-recoverable outage of the message server process.

* Check the non-recoverable outage of the {sap} enqueue server process.

* Check the outage of the {sapERS}.

* Check the outage and restart of {sapStartSrv}.

* Check the simulation of an upgrade.

* Check the simulation of cluster resource failures.

[[multicluster]]
== Multi-node cluster setups for an {sapS4}

*Multinode cluster* setups mean cluster configurations with more than two nodes.
Depending from the starting point it is possible to extend a two node cluster setup or directly start with
more than two nodes for an ASCS / ERS high availability setup.
The examples below will show the setting up of Multi-node cluster and the extension of an existing two node cluster pair. The major configuration changes
will be shown and the basic preparation of the new cluster member node.

The task list to set up the three node cluster is similar to the task list of the two node cluster. But some
details are described different here to get a diskless SBD setup.
Such a diskless SBD setup is an optional improvement for three nodes, but does not work for two nodes.
On the other hand, priority fencing is an optional improvement for two nodes, but does not work for three nodes.
Ssee the {sleHA} product documentation for details
(https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP3/single-html/SLE-HA-administration/#pro-ha-storage-protect-fencing).

NOTE: When extending a cluster from two to three nodes, make sure to not use priority fencing.

////
.Tasks

. Prepare the OS and install the cluster software.
. Prepare watchdog and SBD parameters for diskless SBD.
. Configure the cluster base including corosync and resource manager with diskless SBD.
. Configure the cluster resources.
. Tune the cluster timing in special for the SBD.

// BEGIN OF BLOCKED CHAPTERS FOR MULTINODE 2019-06-18
=== Setting up multinode cluster from the top with diskless SBD

A fencing mechanism is essential for cluster controlled infrastructures. Sometimes there is no possibility
to have a shared block device or an IPMI device. A solution for such environments could be the
diskless SBD option. SBD can be operated in a diskless mode. In this mode, a watchdog device will be
used to reset the node in the following cases: if it loses quorum, if any monitored daemon is lost and not
recovered, or if Pacemaker decides that the node requires fencing. Diskless SBD is based on âself-fencingâ
of a node, depending on the status of the cluster, the quorum and some reasonable assumptions.

IMPORTANT: Do not use diskless SBD as a fencing mechanism for two-node clusters. Use it only
in clusters with three or more nodes. SBD in diskless mode cannot handle split brain scenarios for
two-node clusters.

==== Preparing the OS and installing the cluster software

In general the OS preparation is similar to the procedure described for the two-node cluster.
This includes the setup of NTP as well as installing the software pattern *ha_sles* using *YaST* or *zypper*.

==== Preparing watchdog and SBD parameters for diskless SBD

Diskless SBD does not share a drive for exchanging SBD status. Thus we need to set up SBD parameters carefully
before we initialize the cluster.

.Checking watchdog and start values for diskless SBD

All following commands are executed as user _root_ .

==== Configuring the multi-node cluster base with diskless SBD

.Creating a Multi-node Cluster
==========
This example uses three node but can easily extend to more. A dedicate network interface is used for
the corosync communication (eth1). The option *-S* is special for the diskless mode.

On the first node, execute the following command:
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# ha-cluster-init -u -i eth1 -S
----

On all remaining nodes, execute the following command:
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# ha-cluster-join -i eth1 -c <first cluster node>
----

After all nodes have joined check the cluster status:

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
#  crm status

	Stack: corosync
	Current DC: <node1> (version 1.1.18+20180430.b12c320f5-3.3.1-b12c320f5) - partition with quorum
	Last updated: Thu Apr 25 06:30:50 2019
	Last change: Thu Apr 25 06:30:45 2019 by root via cibadmin on <node1>

	3 nodes configured
	0 resources configured

	Online: [ <node1> <node2> <node3> ]

	No resources
----

This is an example for a three-node cluster _corosync.conf_ file:

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
	# Please read the corosync.conf.5 manual page
	totem {

		}

		node {
			ring0_addr: {myIP3nd3}

	}

	quorum {

		# Enable and configure quorum subsystem (default: off)
		# see also corosync.conf.5 and votequorum.5
		provider: corosync_votequorum
		expected_votes: 3
		two_node: 0
	}
----

Verify the system and enable the SBD service if not done by the setup:

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# systemctl enable sbd
----

Check if the parameter *have-watchdog=true* has been automatically set:

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm configure show | grep have-watchdog
----

Adapt the cluster *stonith-watchdog-timeout* for diskless SBD:

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm configure property stonith-watchdog-timeout=10
----

For diskless SBD, this parameter must not equal zero. It defines after how long it is assumed that the
fencing target has already self-fenced. Therefore its value needs to be >= the value of
SBD_WATCHDOG_TIMEOUT in _/etc/sysconfig/sbd_ .

==========

==== Configuring the cluster resources

The resources for the three node cluster are set up exactly in the same way as for the two node cluster.

// TODO PRIO3:
// ==== Tune the cluster timing in special for the SBD.

=== Extending an existing two-node cluster configuration

.Tasks

. Back up the current cluster.
. Install the OS on the new node.
. Patch the existing nodes.
. Prepare the new node's operating system.
. Prepare SAP.
. Install the cluster software on the new node.
. Joining the cluster.
. Test the new cluster configuration.

==== Backing up the current cluster

To *back up the current cluster*, perform a
==========

* Backup of your system including
** cluster configuration
** corosync.conf
** all data and configuration which are important and customized and not default

The system is configured as described in the SUSE Best Practices document
__SAP S/4 HANA - Enqueue Replication 2 High Availability Cluster - Setup Guide__.

To *back up the cluster configuration*, go to one of the cluster nodes and safe the cluster configuration with _crm_ and _crm report_ commands:

[subs="attributes"]
----
# crm configure save 2node.txt
----

*Back up the existing /etc/corosync/corosync.conf* and all other files which may be important for a restore.
This example is one method creating a backup. The important point is using an *external* destination.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# tar cvf /<path to an *external* storage>/bck_2nodes_configuration.tar \
      /etc/corosync/corosync.conf \
      2node.txt \
      <add your additional files here>
----
==========


==== Installing the operating system of the new cluster node member

We recommend using automating the installation to ensure that the system setup across nodes is identical.
Make sure to document any additional steps you take beyond the automated setup. In our example, we
deploy our machines with an AutoYaST configuration file and run a post step script which does the basic
configuration.

==== Patching existing nodes

If applicable, install the latest updates and patches on your existing nodes.
Alternatively, if you are using frozen repositories such as those provided by SUSE Manager,
add the new system to the same repositories, so they have the same patch level as your
existing nodes.

Use *zypper patch* or *zypper update* depending on your company's rules.

- It is recommended installing the latest available patches to guarantee system stability and hardening.
Bug fixing and security patches help avoid unplanned outages and make the system less vulnerable.

There are multiple ways:

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# zypper patch --category security
## or
# zypper patch --severity important
## or
# zypper patch
## or
# zypper update
----

==== Preparing the new node's operating system

.Check for valid DNS, time synchronization, network settings
==========
- Verify that DNS is working:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# ping <hostname>
----

- Set up *chrony* (this is best done with *YaST*) and enable it:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# yast ntp-client
----

- Check the network settings:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# ip r
----

==========

You may run into trouble if there is no valid or no default route configured.

- Patch the new system like the existing nodes, verify that your systems have the same patch level and
 that all required reboots have been performed.

==== Installing cluster software on the new node

.Installing packages
============
- Install the pattern *ha_sles* on the new cluster node:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# zypper in -t pattern ha_sles
----

- Install the package *{s4sClConnector3}* version 3.1.0 from the SUSE repositories:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# zypper in {s4sClConnector3}
----
============

// ////

After installing all necessary packages, compare installed package versions.

.Check that all nodes have the same software packages and versions
============
- On the existing cluster nodes:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# rpm -qa | sort >rpm_{my3nd1}.log
----

- On the new node:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
# rpm -qa | sort >rpm_{my3nd3}.log
----

- Copy the file from one node to the other and compare the two versions:
+
[subs="attributes"]
----
# vimdiff rpm_{my3nd3}.log rpm_{my3nd1}.log
----
============


NOTE: If there any differences fix them first before you proceed.

.Install and configure the watchdog device on the new machine.
============

Instead of deploying the software-based solution, preferably use a hardware-based watchdog device.
The following example uses the software device but can be easily adapted to the hardware device.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# modprobe softdog
# echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
# systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
# lsmod | egrep "(wd|dog|i6|iT|ibm)"
----
============

NOTE: Ensure that the new node is connected to the same SBD disk connected to the existing two nodes. Ensure that the new node has the same exact SBD configurations already exist on the two existing nodes

[subs="attributes"]
----
# sbd -d {myDevPartSbd} dump
----

==== Preparing the SAP installation on the new node

With SWPM 2.0 (SP4 or later), which is part of the SL Toolset, SAP provides a new option which can perform all necessary steps to prepare a fresh
install server to be able to fit into an existing SAP system. This new option will help us to prepare a
new host which can later run either the ASCS or ERS in the cluster environment.

You need to create the directory structure that should run the SAP resource.
The SYS directory is located on an NFS share for all nodes.

- Create mount points and mount NFS shares on the new added node ({my3nd3}):

.Mount NFS Shares on {my3nd3}
==============================================
[subs="attributes"]
----
# mkdir -p /sapmnt /var/lib/Landscape
# mkdir -p /usr/sap/{mySid}/{{myInstAscs},{myInstErs},SYS}
# mount -t nfs {myNfsSrv}:{myNFSSapmnt}    /sapmnt
# mount -t nfs {myNfsSrv}:{myNFSSys} /usr/sap/{mySid}/SYS
# mount -t nfs {myNfsSrv}:{myNFSSapmedia} /var/lib/Landscape
----
==============================================

As this directory needs to be available at all time, make sure it is mounted during boot. This can be
achieved by put the information into the /etc/fstab.

In the next step the following information are required:
- profile directory
- password for SAP System Administrator
- UID for sapadm

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# cd {mySAPinst}
# ./sapinst
----

* SWPM product installation path:
** Installing {sapS4in}  -> SAP HANA DATABASE -> Installation -> Application Server ABAP
-> High-Availability System -> Prepare Additional Host
* Use /sapmnt/{mySid}/profile for the profile directory
* All passwords: {mySapPwd}
*  UID for sapadm: 2002

.Post Step Procedure after SAP Preparation Step
==========
- Add the user _{mySapAdm}_ to the unix user group _haclient_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# usermod -a -G haclient {mySapAdm}
----

- Register the ASCS and the ERS {sap} instance:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/usr/sap/hostctrl/exe:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH; export LD_LIBRARY_PATH
# /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/<SID>/SYS/profile/<SID>_ERS<instanceNumberErs>_<virtHostNameErs
> -reg
# /usr/sap/hostctrl/exe/sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/<SID>/SYS/profile/<SID>_ASCS<instanceNumberAscs>_<virtHostNameA
scs> -reg
----
+
NOTE: This must be done for each instance. Call sapstartsrv with parameters *pf=*<profile-of-the-sap-instance> 
and *-reg*.
+

- Disable systemd services of the ASCS and the ERS {sap} instance:
+ 
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# systemctl disable SAP{mySid}_{myAscsIno}.service
# systemctl disable SAP{mySid}_{myErsIno}.service
----
+
NOTE: This is mandatory for giving control over the instance to the HA cluster.
+

- Check the {sap} systemd integration:
+ 
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# systemctl list-unit-files | grep sap
saphostagent.service enabled
sapinit.service generated
saprouter.service disabled
saptune.service enabled
# systemctl list-unit-files | grep SAP
SAP{mySid}_{myErsIno}.service disabled
SAP{mySid}_{myErsIno}.service disabled
# cat /usr/sap/sapservices
systemctl --no-ask-password start SAP{mySid}_{myAscsIno} # sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/{mySid}/SYS/profile/{mySid}_{myInstAscs}_{myVipNAscs}
systemctl --no-ask-password start SAP{mySid}_{myErsIno} # sapstartsrv pf=/usr/sap/{mySid}/SYS/profile/{mySid}_{myInstErs}_{myVipNErs}
----
==========

==== Adding the new node to the cluster

.Add the New Node to the Cluster
==========
Check if the SBD device is available in case the SBD stonith method is in place for the two nodes.
If the existing cluster using a different, supported stonith mechanism check and verify them too for the
new cluster node.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# sbd -d {myDevPartSbd} dump
----

- Joining the cluster with _sleha-join_

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# sleha-join -c {my2nd1}
----

After the new node has joined into the cluster the configuration must be adapted to the new situation.
Double check if the join was successful and verify the _/etc/corosync/corosync.conf_

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# grep votes -n2 /etc/corosync/corosync.conf
----

The values *expected_votes* and *two_node* should now look like this on all nodes:

* expected_votes: 3
* two_node: 0

Modify the cluster configuration and set a new colocation rule with _crm_:

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm configure delete col_sap_{mySid}_no_both
# crm configure colocation ASCS{myAscsIno}_ERS{myErsIno}_separated_{mySid} -5000: grp_{mySid}_ERS{myErsIno} grp_{mySid}_ASCS{myAscsIno}
----
==========

==== Testing the new cluster configuration

It is highly recommended to run certain test to verify that the new configuration is working as expected.
A list of test can be found in the basic setup for the two node cluster above.

=== Pro's and con's for odd and even numbers of cluster nodes

There are certain use cases and infrastructure requirements which end up in different installation setup's.
We will cover some advantages and disadvantages of special configuration below:

* The two node cluster and two locations
    - Advantage: symmetric spread of all nodes over all locations
    - Disadvantage: no diskless SBD feature allowed for all two node clusters
* The two node cluster and more than two locations
    - Advantage: SBD device can be provided from there (must be HA himself)
    - Advantage: cluster could operate with three SBD devices from different locations
    - Disadvantage: no diskless SBD feature allowed for all two node clusters
* The three node cluster and two locations
    - Advantage: less complex infrastructure
    - Advantage: diskless SBD feature is allowed
    - Disadvantage: "pre selected" location (two node + one node)
* The three node cluster and three locations
    - Advantage: symmetric spread of all nodes over all locations
    - Advantage: diskless SBD feature is allowed
    - Disadvantage: higher planing effort and complexity for infrastructure planning
