:pg: PostgreSQL
:redis: Redis

In the instructions below, we only describe one variant of installing {pg}.
There are other possible ways to set up {pg} which are not covered in this guide. It is also possible 
to install {pg} as a single instance on the operating system.
We will focus on installing {pg} in a Kubernetes cluster as we also need a {redis} database and we will clustering that together. 

IMPORTANT::
SUSE does *not* offer database support for {pg} on Kubernetes.
To get support, go to link:https://www.postgresql.org/support/[The PostgreSQL Global Development Group].


IMPORTANT::
In this guide we'll describe one variant of installing {pg}.
There are other possible ways to setup {pg} which are not focussed in this guide. It is also possible to install {pg} as a single instance on top of our operation system.
We will focus on installing {pg} into a kubernetes cluster, because we also need a {redis} database and we will put them together into one cluster. 

== Deploying {pg}
Even though {pg} is available for deployment using the {rancher} Apps, we recommend to use the {rac}.
The {pg} chart can be found at https://apps.rancher.io/applications/postgresql.

== Create Secret for {rac}
First we need to create a namespace and the *imagePullSecret* for installing the {pg} database into the cluster.
[source, bash]
----
$ kubectl create namespace postgresql
----

[#pgIPS]
How to create the *imagePullSecret* is described in the Section xref:SAP-EIC-ImagePullSecrets.adoc#imagePullSecret[].

=== Create Secret with certificates
Second we need to create the Kubernetes secret with the certificates. You will find an example how to do this in the xref:SAP-EIC-Main.adoc#selfSignedCertificates[].

=== Installing the application
[#pgLIR]
Before you can install the application, you need to login into the registry. You can find the instruction in xref:SAP-EIC-LoginRegistryApplicationCollection.adoc#LoginApplicationCollection[]

Create a file *values.yaml* which holds some configuration for the {pg} Helm chart.
The config may look like:
[source, yaml]
----
global:
  # -- Global override for container image registry pull secrets
  imagePullSecrets: ["application-collection"]
images:
  postgresql:
    # -- Image name to use for the PostgreSQL container
    repository: dp.apps.rancher.io/containers/postgresql
    # -- Image tag to use for the PostgreSQL container
    tag: "15.7"
auth:
  # -- PostgreSQL username for the superuser
  postgresUsername: postgres
  # -- PostgreSQL password for the superuser
  postgresPassword: "<your_password>"
  # -- Replication username
  replicationUsername: replication
  # -- Replication password
  replicationPassword: "<your_password>"
tls:
  # -- Enable SSL/TLS
  enabled: false
  # -- Name of the secret containing the PostgreSQL certificates
  existingSecret: "postgresqlcert"
  # -- Whether or with what priority a secure SSL TCP/IP connection will be negotiated with the server. Valid values: prefer (default), disable, allow, require, verify-ca, verify-full
  sslMode: "verify-full"
  # -- Certificate filename in the secret (will be ignored if empty)
  certFilename: "server.pem"
  # -- Certificate key filename in the secret (will be ignored if empty)
  keyFilename: "server.key"
  # -- CA certificate filename in the secret (will be ignored if empty)
  caCertFilename: "root.pem"
persistentVolumeClaimRetentionPolicy:
  whenDeleted: Delete
----

To install the application run:
[source, bash]
----
$ helm install metallb oci://dp.apps.rancher.io/charts/postgres -f values.yaml --namespace=postgres
