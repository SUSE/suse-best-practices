# tag::harvester-intro[]
{harvester} is an open-source hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) software that simplifies the management of 
virtual machines (VMs) and containerized workloads on bare metal servers. This cloud native virtualization platform leverages 
core open source technologies like Linux, KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), Kubernetes, KubeVirt, and {lh}, 
offering a flexible and cost-effective alternative to traditional virtualization.

=== Setting up {harvester}

Follow the instructions at the:
link:https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/[official website for {harvester}]
for detailed information on how to set up {harvester}.

NOTE: Make sure you meet the hardware requirements specified in 
https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/requirements
to set up your {harvester} environments.

=== Integrating {harvester} into {rancher}

IMPORTANT: Make sure you checked the support matrix and use a supported {rancher} version:
https://www.suse.com/suse-harvester/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/harvester-v1-4-x/

To benefit from the synergies {rancher} and {harvester} can create, you need to import your {harvester} instance into the {rancher} UI.
To do so, follow the steps described here:
link:https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/rancher/virtualization-management[Importing Harvester cluster]

=== Uploading images to {harvester}

To find information how to upload images to {harvester} that will be used to spin up virtual machines, refer to:

https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/image/upload-image

WARNING: Make sure to only use OS images that are supported with {harvester}.
Find an overview of the currently supported images at https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/vm/virtual-machines .

# tag::harvester-kubernetes-storage[]

A benefit of using {harvester} is the provisioning of storage to your Kubernetes clusters.
If you create a cluster as described in xref:SAP-Rancher-RKE2-Installation.adoc#installRKE2Harvester[the previous chapter], a _storageClass_ will automatically be created within your Kubernetes cluster.

# end::harvester-kubernetes-storage[]


# tag::harvester-lb[]

You can use {harvester} to create a guest Kubernetes cluster load balancer, as also described at 
https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/networking/loadbalancer#guest-kubernetes-cluster-load-balancer
and
https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/rancher/cloud-provider/#load-balancer-support.

== Creating an IP Pool in {harvester}

To create an IP Pool, log in to your {harvester} instance and go to *Networks -> IP Pools*.
Click *Create* in the upper right corner to create a new IP Pool:

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-IPPool-Empty.png[title=Create a new IP Pool,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]



On the next screen, you should see a menu similar to this:

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-IPPool-Create.png[title=Create IP Pool Menu,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

Click *Edit as YAML* and adjust the IP Pool to your needs.

Find an example for an IP Pool below:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: loadbalancer.harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
kind: IPPool
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  selector:
    network: default/vlan11
    scope:
      - guestCluster: '*'
        namespace: '*'

  ranges:
    - gateway: 192.17.218.1
      rangeEnd: 192.17.218.30
      rangeStart: 192.17.218.5
      subnet: 192.17.218.1/22
      type: range
----

When you are done, click the *Create* button at the bottom right.

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-IPPool-Example.png[title=IP Pool Example,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]


At this stage, your IP Pool should have been created and appear in the list of IP Pools.

This section describes how to set up a load balancer using {harvester} to distribute traffic to virtual machines.

IMPORTANT: This approach only works with {harvester} 1.4.2 or higher and requires that the target virtual machines be connected to the management network of {harvester}. 

If your management network is not managed by a DHCP, your first step is to create an IP Pool.

To create a Load Balancer, log in to your {harvester} instance and go to *Networks -> Load Balancers*.
Click *Create* in the upper right corner to create a new Load Balancer:

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-LB-Empty.png[title=Create New Load Balancer,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]


On the next screen, you should see a menu similar to this:

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-LB-Create.png[title=Create Load Balancer Menu,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

Select the IPAM method you want to use - either DHCP or Pool.

// TODO image


Next, configure the *Listeners*. The *Port* is the port on which the Load Balancer will listen for requests. 
The *Backend Port* is the port of the target virtual machine the traffic is forwarded to.
If you want to use this Load Balancer to forward traffic to a {rancher} management cluster, you need to configure two listeners:

[options="header"]
|===
|Name |Protocol|Port|Backend Port
|http|TCP|80|80
|https|TCP|443|443
|===

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-LB-Listeners.png[title=Configuring Load Balancer Listeners,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]


The next step is to configure the *Backend Server Selector*.
Here, you will specify which virtual machines the Load Balancer will target.
To do this, the *Key* and *Value* must match the *Instance Labels* of the target virtual machines.
