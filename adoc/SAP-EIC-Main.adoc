== Prerequisites

* Get subscriptions for:
** {rancher4SAP} *
** {sle_ha} **

+++*+++ The {rancher4SAP} subscription holds support for all required components like {slem}, {rancher} and {lh}.

+++**+++ Only needed if you want to set up {rancher} in a high availability setup

Additionally,

* check the storage requirements.

* create a or get access to a private container registry.

* get an SAP S-user ID to access software and documentation from SAP.

* read the relevant SAP documentation:

** https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839[Release Note for SAP Edge Integration Cell]

** https://me.sap.com/notes/2946788[Release Note for SAP ELM Bridge]

== Landscape Overview

To run {eic} in a production-ready and supported way, you need to set up multiple Kubernetes clusters and their nodes.
Those comprise a Kubernetes cluster, where you will install {rancher} to set up and manage the production and non-production clusters.
For this {rancher} cluster, we recommend using three Kubernetes nodes and a load balancer.

The {eic} will need to run in a dedicated Kubernetes cluster.
For an HA setup of this cluster, we recommend using three Kubernetes control planes and three Kubernetes worker nodes.

For a graphical overview of what is needed, take a look at the landscape overview:

image::SAP-EIC-Architecture.svg[title=Architecture Overview,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

* The dark blue rectangles represent Kubernetes clusters.
* The olive rectangles represent Kubernetes nodes that hold the roles of Control Plane and Worker combined.
* The green rectangles represent Kubernetes Control Plane nodes.
* The orange rectangles represent Kubernetes Worker nodes.

This graphic overview is used throughout the guide to illustrate the purpose and context of each step.


Starting with installing the operating system of each machine or Kubernetes node, we will guide you through the complete setup of a Kubernetes landscape ready for {eic} deployment.

== Installing {slem} {slem_version}
There are several ways to install {slem} {slem_version}. For this best practice guide, we use the installation method via graphical installer. 
But in cloud native deployments, it is highly recommended to use Infrastructure-as-Code technologies to fully automate the deployment and lifecycle processes.

== Installing {rancher} cluster

By now, you should have the operating system installed on every Kubernetes node.
You are ready to install a {rancher} cluster.
Referring to the landscape overview, we now focus on how to set up the upper section of the graphic below:

== Installing RKE2 using {rancher}

After having installed the {rancher} cluster, you can use it to create {rke} clusters for {eic}.
SAP recommends setting separate QA/Dev systems for {eic} in addition to a production landscape. 
Both can be configured similarly using {rancher}, as described in this chapter.
Referring to the landscape overview, we now focus on the lower section of the graphic below:

[#preparingStorage]
== Preparing storage

To make storage available for Kubernetes workloads, prepare the storage solution you want to use.
In this chapter, we describe how to set this up and how to prepare it for consumption by {eic}.

The storage solutions tested by SAP and SUSE are presented below, along with links to chapters detailing how to set them up and configure them.

== Installing {metallb} and databases

In the following chapter, we present an example for setting up {metallb}, {redis} and {pg}.

NOTE: Keep in mind that the descriptions and instructions below might differ from the deployment you need for your specific infrastructure and use cases.

=== Logging in to {rac}

To access the {rac}, you need to log in. You can do this using the console and Helm client.
The easiest way to do so is to use the built-in shell in {rancher}. To access it, navigate to your cluster and click *Kubectl Shell* as shown below:

image::EIC-Rancher-Kubectl-Button.png[title=Rancher Shell Access,scaledwidth=99%]

A shell will open as shown in the image below:

image::EIC-Rancher-Kubectl-Shell.png[title=Rancher Shell Overview,scaledwidth=99%]


You must log in to {rac}. This can be done as follows:

[source, bash]
----
helm registry login dp.apps.rancher.io/charts -u <yourUser> -p <your-token>
----


=== Installing {metallb} on Kubernetes cluster

The following chapter should guide you through the installation and configuration of {metallb} on your Kubernetes cluster used for {eic}.

include::SAP-EIC-Metallb.adoc[Metallb, leveloffset=2]


=== Installing {redis}

// https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/prepare-your-kubernetes-cluster#redis-data-store-requirements

Before deploying {redis}, ensure that the requirements described at
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839 are met.

Also, make sure you understand what grade of persistence you want to achieve for your {redis} cluster.
For more information about persistence in {redis}, see
https://redis.io/docs/management/persistence/.

=== Installing {pg}

// https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/prepare-your-kubernetes-cluster#postgresql-database-requirements

Before deploying {pg}, ensure that the requirements described at
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839 are met.

=== Using self-signed certificates

In this chapter, we explain how to create self-signed certificates and make them available within Kubernetes. 
We describe two methods: generating them manually on the operating system layer or using `cert-manager` in your downstream cluster.

include::SAP-EIC-General.adoc[tags=self-signed-certificates]

You should now have the files _server.pem_, _server.key_ and _chained.pem_, which can be used for applications such as Redis or PostgresSQL.
