Creating new RKE2 clusters is very easy when using {rancher}.


Go to the home menu of your {rancher} instance.
Click the *Create* button on the right side of the screen, as shown here:

The window shows you the available options for creating new Kubernetes clusters.
Make sure the toggle button on the right side of the screen is set to *RKE2/K3s* as shown below:

If you want to create Kubernetes clusters on existing (virtual) machines, select the *Custom* option at the very bottom, as shown in the image below:

image::SAP-Rancher-Create-Custom.png[title=Rancher create custom cluster,scaledwidth=99%]

Next, you will see a window to configure your Kubernetes cluster. It will look similar to the image below:

image::SAP-Rancher-Create-Config.png[title=Rancher create custom cluster config,scaledwidth=99%]

Here, you need to name the cluster. The name will only be used within {rancher}. It will not affect your workloads.
In the next step, make sure you select a Kubernetes version that is supported by the workload you want to deploy.

[#metal-rke]
If you do not plan to use {metallb}, continue xref:SAP-Rancher-RKE2-Installation.adoc#nmetallb[below].

To prepare {rke} for running {metallb}, you need to enable `strictarp` mode for `ipvs` in `kube-proxy`.
To enable `strictarp` for clusters you want to roll out using {rancher}, you need to add the following lines to your configuration:


[source,yaml]
----
machineGlobalConfig:
  kube-proxy-arg:
    - proxy-mode=ipvs
    - ipvs-strict-arp=true
----

To do so, apply all configurations as usuall and click the *Edit as YAML* button in the creation step, as shown below:

image::SAP-Rancher-Create-Config-YAML.png[title=Rancher create custom cluster yaml config,scaledwidth=99%]

The excerpt must be saved under _spec.rkeConfig_. An example can be seen here:

If you do not have any further requirements to Kubernetes, click *Create* at the very bottom.
In all other cases speak to your administrators before making any adjustements.

After you click *Create*, you should see a screen like this:

image::SAP-Rancher-Create-Register.png[title=Rancher create registration,scaledwidth=99%]

Now, in a first step, select the roles your node(s) should receive.
A common high avaiability setup holds:

* 3 x etcd / controll plane nodes
* 3 x worker nodes

The next step is to copy the registration command to the target machines' shell and execute it.
If your {rancher} instance holds a self-signed certifcate, make sure to activate the text bar holding the registration command in the check box below .

You can run the command on all nodes in parallel. You do not need to wait until a single node is down.
When all machines are registered, you can see the cluster status at the top, changing from "updating" to "active".
At this point in time, your Kubernetes cluster is ready to be used.
