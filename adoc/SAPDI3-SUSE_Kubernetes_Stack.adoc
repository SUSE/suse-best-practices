= {di} 3 on SUSE's Kubernetes Stack

== Introduction

This guide describes the on-premises installation of {di} {di_version} using {harvester} and Rancher Kubernetes Engine (RKE) 2.
In a nutshell, the installation of {di} {di_version} consists of the following steps:

* Installing {harvester}

* Installing {rancher}

* Installing RKE 2 Kubernetes cluster on the dedicated nodes

* Deploying {di} {di_version} on RKE 2 Kubernetes cluster

* Performing post-installation steps for {di} {di_version}

* Testing the installation of {di} {di_version}

To have a fully supported setup, there are two Kubernetes clusters required.
One runs {rancher} Management server and the other runs the actual workload, which for the purpose of this guide is {di}.

== Preparations

* Get a {sles} {sles_version} subscription.

* Download the installer for {sles} {sles_version}.

* Check the storage requirements.

* Create a or get access to a private container registry.

* Get an SAP S-user to access software and documentation by SAP.

* Read the relevant SAP documentation:

Within the scope of this guide it is recommended to deploy three master nodes (roles: etcd & Control Plane) and four worker nodes (roles: Worker) for {di}.
Check <<Hardware Sizing>> to fill out the machine specific configurations to meet the requirements for the given purpose and <<Provisioning virtual machines with RKE2>> to get an overview how to roll out an RKE2 cluster using {harvester}.

When all machines are provisioned and the RKE2 cluster is up and running, a storage must be made available for {di}.
SUSE offers {lh} which is a validated storage for {di} workloads. The next chapter describes how to set up {lh}.

IMPORTANT: {di} requires an S3 compatible storage for its backups, which is not delivered by {lh}. Check 
https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/2871970[the related SAP Note] to get an overview of the supported storage solutions together with RKE2.
