=== Deploying Redis using the Rancher App

Navigate to Apps -> Charts. You can us the search bar on the right hand side or search manually for the {redis} App.
Once found, click on it.

You'll now see a description of the {redis} helm chart. On the right hand side, you'll see a list of "Chart Versions" and the related "Application Version" below.
Make sure the chosen version is supported as stated in 
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839
and hit the "Install" button on the upper right hand side.

// TODO Which namespace to deploy into?
Next, you'll need to pick the namespace you want to deploy {redis} into.
When done, click the "Next" button at the bottom right of the website.

As a last step, you'll need to modify the {redis} configuration.

Adjust the storageClass in the manifest to match your storage solution.
If you use :longhorn:, your manifest would have related lines look like:
----
storageClass: 'longhorn'
