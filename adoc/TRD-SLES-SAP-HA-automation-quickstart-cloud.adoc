= Using SUSE Automation to Deploy an SAP HANA Cluster on {cloud}


== About the guide

This document will walk you through the deployment of a simple two-node SAP HANA HA Cluster using the SUSE Automation Project for SAP Solutions Project and operating on {cloud}.


This project uses Terraform and Salt to deploy and configure the operating system ({sles4sap}), SAP software (SAP HANA), and a SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability (HA) cluster.
If extensive configuration and customization are required, refer to the project documentation at https://github.com/SUSE/ha-sap-terraform-deployments.

For simplicity, this guide uses the Cloud Shell to perform the deployment, as it provides easy access to most of the required tooling.

It is possible to use a local Linux or macOS computer, but some commands may need modification or omission.

The architecture for the deployment is similar to the one shown below:

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
image::TRD_SLES-SAP-HA-automation-quickstart-cloud-azure-automation-architecture.png[title=Azure Automation Architecture,scaledwidth=99%]
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
image::TRD_SLES-SAP-HA-automation-quickstart-cloud-aws-automation-architecture.jpg[title=AWS Automation Architecture,scaledwidth=99%]
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
image::TRD_SLES-SAP-HA-automation-quickstart-cloud-gcp-automation-architecture.png[title=SUSE Automation for SAP HANA on Google Cloud Platform Architecture,scaledwidth=99%]
endif::[]

The project will perform the following actions:

* Deploying infrastructure - including Virtual Network, subnet, firewall rules etc.
* Deploying instances - 2x SAP HANA Instances
* Configuring the operating system for SAP workload
* Running the SAP HANA installation
* Configuring SAP HANA System Replication (HSR)
* Configuring SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability cluster components and resources


== Configuring the Cloud Shell

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
Start an Azure Cloud Shell simply from the top menu within Azure Portal. It is the small icon with the command line prompt.

After its started the first time, you can choose between "Bash" and "powershell". Select "Bash".

The Cloud Shell is a managed service by Microsoft, and comes with the most popular command line tools and language support you need.
The Cloud Shell also securely authenticates automatically for instant access to your resources through the Azure CLI or Azure PowerShell cmdlets.
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
Start an AWS Cloud Shell from the AWS Services menu.

When the shell has launched, the next step is to configure the CLI and provide API access keys to allow the creation of AWS resources and infrastructure.
The API Keys are created from the AWS console. For more details, refer to
https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-configure-quickstart.html

The quickest way to configure the AWS CLI is by running the command:

----
aws configure
----

This is described in the documentation linked above.

The command generates a file in `$HOME/.aws/credentials` which is referenced later.

IMPORTANT: The user specified in this step needs certain AWS permissions to ensure the deployment is successful.
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
IMPORTANT: The Google Cloud Platform (GCP) user specified in the below-mentioned steps needs certain GCP Project permissions to ensure the deployment is successful.
For simplification, the GCP user used in this guide has the _Project Owner_ IAM role.

The following procedures show the minimum steps required to prepare the GCP infrastructure to host the SAP HANA environment:

. Create a new GCP Project to host the SAP HANA environment.
. Enable the GCP Compute Engine API.
. Using the newly created GCP project console, start a GCP Cloud Shell.
. Using the GCP Cloud Shell, create a new GCP Key for the default GCP Service Account. The key will be used by Terraform to access the GCP infrastructure.
+
TIP: For more details about creating a GCP Service Account key, refer to https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/creating-managing-service-account-keys#iam-service-account-keys-create-gcloud
+
NOTE: For simplification, the default GCP Service Account will be used in this guide.
endif::[]


== Ensuring Terraform is installed

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
Terraform is already deployed as part of the Azure Cloud Shell. The following command output shows the Terraform version used at the time of creating this guide:
----
$ terraform -v
Terraform v1.0.0
on linux_amd64
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

Terraform is not currently deployed as part of the AWS Cloud Shell, in this step Terraform is downloaded and installed to the `~/bin` directory.
Update the command below with the latest version of Terraform as needed.
As Terraform is updated on a regular basis, it may be necessary to update after installation, or specify a different version to download.

From the `~` directory, run:

----
mkdir ~/bin
cd ~/bin
wget https://releases.hashicorp.com/terraform/0.14.7/terraform_0.14.7_linux_amd64.zip
unzip terraform_0.14.7_linux_amd64.zip
cd ~
----

Check Terraform is working by running:

----
terraform --version
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
Terraform is already deployed as part of the GCP Cloud Shell. The following command output shows the Terraform version used at the time of creating this guide:

----
$ terraform -v
Terraform v1.0.0
on linux_amd64
----
endif::[]


== Preparing the SAP HANA media

With the correct entitlement, SAP HANA media can be downloaded from the SAP Web site at https://support.sap.com/en/my-support/software-downloads.html. The SAP Media needs to be made available so it can be accessed during the deployment.

The SUSE Automation for SAP Applications project allows for three methods for presenting the SAP media:

. SAR file and SAPCAR executable (SAP HANA Database only)
. Multipart exe/RAR files
. Extracted media

The different formats come with some benefits and drawbacks:

. The compressed archives (SAR and RAR) provide a simple copy to the cloud but a longer install time because of extracting it during the process.
. The uncompressed/extracted media are the fastest install, but more files are copied to the cloud share, which also takes time in forehand as preparation.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" != "Google Cloud Platform" ]
In the example at hand, we use the compressed archives for the install (exe/RAR) as it is the easiest way to download and upload to the cloud share.

This guide uses the most recent SAP HANA media, {hana_version}. The SAP HANA media file name downloaded at the time of creating this guide is `{hana_archive_version}`.
Follow the SAP instructions to download the SAP HANA media.
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
// TODO - Add a comment regarding extracting SAP media using `unzip` or SAPCAR
// TODO - Add a note to have the SAP workstation on Google Cloud

In this example, we use the extracted archives for the installation as it is the fastest deployment way.

NOTE: This however depends on the method used to download the SAP media. If multiple compressed files are downloaded, the official SAP extract tool `SAPCAR` tool must be used to extract the SAP media.

TIP: The extracted SAP Media can contain a lot of files. Depending on your network speed, it can consume time to upload the extracted SAP media files. Google Cloud infrastructure provides a breakneck network speed. Create a Google Cloud compute engine workstation machine to download/upload the SAP media. The other option is to use fast speed internet connection.

endif::[]

[TIP]
====
It is a good practice to have the SAP Media versioned on the cloud share to build a library for automatic installs and (re)deployments.
Thus you should think about your SAP media structure first.

As an *example*, see below how a full SAP Application media tree (in a compressed format) for a S/4HANA version 1809 install would look like:
----
<FS>/s4hana1809
       ├SWPM_CD
       │  ├SWPM20SP07_5-80003424.SAR
       │  └SAPCAR_721-20010450.EXE
       │
       ├EXP_CD
       │  ├S4CORE104_INST_EXPORT_1.zip
       │  ├S4CORE104_INST_EXPORT_2.zip
       │  └...
       ├DBCLIENT_CD
       │  └IMDB_CLIENT20_005_111-80002082.SAR
       ├BASKET_CD

          ├51053061_part3.rar
          └51053061_part4.rar


 HANA       : contains the HANA Database install
 BASKET_ CD : contains SAP kernel, patch + more like hostagent.
 DBCLIENT_CD: contains the package corresponding to DB CLIENT, e.g HANA
 EXP_CD     : contains the package corresponding to EXPORT files
 SWPM_CD    : must contain the .exe file corresponding to SAPCAR and the
              .sar file corresponding to SWPM.
              The file suffix must be .exe and .sar.
----
====


In the next steps, we use a simple HANA install download.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
For Azure, an Azure File Share is used to host the SAP HANA media.

Using the Azure Portal or the Azure CLI, perform the following actions:

* Create a storage account
* Create a folder within the Storage Account, for example "mysapmedia"
* Upload the SAP media files to the Storage Account

image::TRD_SLES-SAP-HA-automation-quickstart-cloud-Azure-Storage.png[width=470]

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
For AWS, an S3 bucket is used.

Using the AWS Console, perform the following actions:

* Create an S3 bucket. (The example shows a bucket called mysapmedia, but a unique name should be used.)
* Create a folder within the bucket.
* Upload the SAP media to the folder in the S3 bucket.

image::TRD_SLES-SAP-HA-automation-quickstart-cloud-s3-bucket.png[width=470]

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
A GCP Cloud Storage bucket is used to host the SAP HANA extracted media. Using the GCP Console, perform the following actions:

* Create a new GCP bucket. (The example shows a GCP Cloud Storage bucket called `mysapmedia`, but a unique name should be used.)
* Upload the SAP HANA media extracted directory to the GCP Cloud Storage bucket. The following figure shows the uploaded SAP HANA media extracted directory:
+
image::trd_sles-sap-ha-automation-quickstart-cloud-gcp-bucket.png[title=SAP HANA GCP Storage Bucket, scaledwidth=99%]
endif::[]



== Downloading and configuring the SUSE Automation code

The SUSE SAP Automation code is published in GitHub.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "GCP"]
The following commands will:

. Create a new GCP Cloud Shell directory to host the SUSE SAP automation code
. Change directory to the newly created directory

----
$ mkdir suse-sap-automation
$ cd suse-sap-automation
----
endif::[]


The following command will clone the project to the Cloud Shell ready for configuration:
----
$ git clone --depth 1 --branch 7.2.0 https://github.com/SUSE/ha-sap-terraform-deployments.git
----

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
Next, move the generated GCP Service Account Key to the SUSE SAP Automation GCP directory:
----
$ cd ~
$ cp <GCP Service Account Key> suse-sap-automation/ha-sap-terraform-deployments/gcp
----
endif::[]


NOTE: If the following SSH keys already exist, the next step can be skipped.

Then, generate SSH key pairs to allow for accessing the SAP HANA instances:
----
#optional if ssh-keys already exist
$ cd ~
$ ssh-keygen -q -t rsa -N '' -f  ~/.ssh/id_rsa
----

=== Configuring the deployment options and modifying the Terraform variables

The files that need to be configured are contained in a subdirectory of the project. Use that as the working directory:

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
----
cd ~/ha-sap-terraform-deployments/azure
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
----
cd ~/ha-sap-terraform-deployments/aws
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
----
$ cd ~/suse-sap-automation/ha-sap-terraform-deployments/gcp
----
endif::[]


A Terraform example template is provided. For a demo environment consisting of a simple HANA cluster, only a handful of parameters will need changing.

Copy the Terraform example file to `terraform.tfvars`:
----
$ cp terraform.tfvars.example terraform.tfvars
----


Edit the `terraform.tfvars` file and modify it as explained below.
If you are duplicating the lines before modification, ensure the original is commented out, or the deployment will fail.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
// nothing needed for AZURE
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

With this parameter, Terraform will use the AWS credentials file created above. It is the simplest way to provide credentials for the deployment.
----
aws_credentials = "~/.aws/credentials"
----

If not used, ensure the following lines are commented out or the deployment will fail.

----
#aws_access_key_id = my-access-key-id
#aws_secret_access_key = my-secret-access-key
----
endif::[]


ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
First, choose the GCP Project ID for the deployment:
----
# GCP project id
project = "<PROJECT ID>"
----

Then, choose the GCP Service Account Key file path. With the following parameter, Terraform will use the GCP Service Account Key file created above:
----
# Credentials file for GCP
gcp_credentials_file = "<GCP Service Account Key Path and Name>"
----
endif::[]


Choose the region for the deployment, for example:
ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
----
# Region where to deploy the configuration
az_region = "westeurope"
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
----
# Region where to deploy the configuration
aws_region = "eu-central-1"
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
----
# Region where to deploy the configuration
region = "europe-west1"
----
endif::[]

The following parameters select the version of {sles4sap} to deploy:

NOTE: The values shown equal the default values. All defaults point to PAYG images for an easy start. Thus you only need to enable or change the variables if you want to work with different values.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
// this is also the default
----
#os_image = "sles-sap-15-sp2:gen2"
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
 // this is also the default
For simplicity, the 'os_owner' is set to use PAYG instances from the AWS Marketplace. If an existing SUSE subscription needs to be used, this section can be changed to use BYOS images. Refer to the project documentation.
----
#os_image = "suse-sles-sap-15-sp2"
#os_owner = "679593333241"
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
// this is also the default
----
#os_image = "suse-sap-cloud/sles-15-sp2-sap"
----
endif::[]

Next, enter the path for the public and private SSH keys that were generated earlier. Below is an example using the default created SSH keys:
----
# SSH Public key location to configure access to the remote instances
public_key  = "~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub"

# Private SSH Key location
private_key = "~/.ssh/id_rsa"
----

To keep the cluster architecture and deployment simple and to provide additional packages needed to deploy, uncomment and set the following parameters:

----
ha_sap_deployment_repo = "https://download.opensuse.org/repositories/network:/ha-clustering:/sap-deployments:/v7/"
----

Then, enable the `pre_deployment` parameter:
----
pre_deployment = true
----

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
The Jumphost server (Bastion Host Server) is enabled by default, and provide the public IP adress to the database.
Otherwise the two HANA servers will get a public ip
----
#bastion_enabled = true
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
// Question to Ab:  Why do you disable the bastion?
The Jumphost server (Bastion Host Server) is enabled by default, and provide the public IP adress to the database.
Otherwise the two HANA servers will get a public ip.

Disable the Bastion Host Server creation parameter `bastion_enabled`:
----
bastion_enabled = false
----
endif::[]

Next, set which SAP HANA instance machine type should be selected:
The default is set to some standard types, and you only need to enable and change the variable if you want other sizes.

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
----
#hana_vm_size = "Standard_E4s_v3"
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
----
#hana_instancetype = "r3.xlarge"
----

Next set the hostname for the instances, without the domain part
----
name = "hana"
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
----
#machine_type = "n1-highmem-32"
----
endif::[]


Modify the following parameter to point to SAP media that was uploaded to the storage location:

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
----
storage_account_name = "YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME"
storage_account_key = "YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_KEY"
----

The "hana_inst_master" parameter needs to be set according to your settings of the file share you created before.
Find an example below:
// all three should be better aligned and build on a fixed structure
----
hana_inst_master = "//YOUR_STORAGE_ACCOUNT_NAME.file.core.windows.net/mysapmedia"

hana_archive_file = "s4hana1809/HANA/{hana_archive_version}.exe"
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]
----
hana_inst_master = "s3://mysapmedia/s4hana1809/HANA"

hana_archive_file = "{hana_archive_version}.exe"
----

endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
[subs="attributes"]
----
hana_inst_master = "mysapmedia/{hana_archive_version}"
----
endif::[]

To create the cluster, we need to set this parameter to *true*, otherwise only a single system is created.
----
# Enable system replication and HA cluster
hana_ha_enabled = true
----

Finally, to ensure a fully automated deployment, it is possible to set passwords within the `terraform.tfvars` file. Uncomment and set the following parameters to your own value:
----
hana_master_password = "SAP_Pass123"
----

NOTE: If the parameters are not set in the `terraform.tfvars` file, they must be entered when running the deployment.

IMPORTANT: All passwords must conform to SAP password policies or the deployment will fail.

Optional: If a monitoring instance should be as part of the deployment, find and uncomment the following:

----
monitoring_enabled = true
----


== Finalizing the automation configuration

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
Ensure that the subscription used to host the SAP HANA HA cluster meets the infrastructure quota requirements. For more info, refer to https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/virtual-machines/workloads/sap/get-started
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

=== Subscribing to the AWS Marketplace offer

To automatically deploy instances from the AWS Marketplace, ensure to *Subscribe* to the offering.

A link for {sles4sap} 15 SP2 can be found at link:https://aws.amazon.com/marketplace/server/procurement?productId=e9701ac9-43ee-4dda-b944-17c6c231c8db[].

If a different version of {sles4sap} is required, subscribe to the relevant version on the marketplace.


== Configuring IAM policies

If the deployment is being run from the root user of the AWS account, or if the user specified when configuring the AWS CLI has
Admin privileges in your AWS account, you can skip this step.

If using an IAM user with limited permissions, additional IAM rights may be required as IAM policies are created and attached
during deployment, for example to access and manage EC2 instances, S3 buckets, IAM (to create roles and policies) and EFS storage.

There are two options available to achieve this:

a. Attach the *IAMFullAccess* policy to the user executing the project. However, this is not recommended.
b. The recommended method is to create a new IAM policy and attach it to the desired user.

TIP: Depending on your own IAM rights, you may need to reach out to an AWS administrator for your account to set this up for you.

Create the following policy and attach it to the IAM user running the deployment:

----
{
    "Version": "2012-10-17",
    "Statement": [
        {
            "Effect": "Allow",
            "Action": [
                "iam:CreateServiceLinkedRole",
                "iam:PassRole",
                "iam:CreateRole",
                "iam:TagRole",
                "iam:GetRole",
                "iam:DeleteRole",
                "iam:GetRolePolicy",
                "iam:PutRolePolicy",
                "iam:DeleteRolePolicy",
                "iam:ListInstanceProfilesForRole",
                "iam:CreateInstanceProfile",
                "iam:GetInstanceProfile",
                "iam:RemoveRoleFromInstanceProfile",
                "iam:DeleteInstanceProfile",
                "iam:AddRoleToInstanceProfile"
            ],
            "Resource": "*"
        }
    ]
}
----
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Google Cloud Platform" ]
Ensure that the GCP Project used to host the SAP HANA HA cluster meets the infrastructure quota requirements set by Google Cloud. For more info, refer to https://cloud.google.com/solutions/sap/docs/sap-hana-planning-guide#quotas
endif::[]


== Deploying the project

Terraform will create and name resources when running the deployment based on the "workspace" in use.
It is highly recommended to create a unique workspace from which to run the deployment.

----
$ terraform init
$ terraform workspace new demo
$ terraform workspace select demo
$ terraform plan
$ terraform apply
----

TIP: The Cloud Shell has a timeout of around 20 minutes and the shell will close if left
unattended, resulting in a failed deployment.  It is strongly advised to retain focus on the Cloud Shell window to ensure the timeout does not occur.


ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "Azure" ]
If successful, the output will be the public IP addresses for the cluster nodes.
endif::[]

ifeval::[ "{cloud}" == "AWS" ]

If successful, the output will be the public IP addresses for the cluster nodes similar to the output below.
