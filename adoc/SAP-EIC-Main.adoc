This guide describes how to prepare your infrastructure for the installation of {eic} on {rke} using {rancher}.
It will guide you through the steps of:

* Installing {rancher}
* Setting up {rke} clusters
* Deploying mandatory components for {eic}
// * Deploying {eic} into your {rke}

== Prerequisites

* Get subscriptions for:
** {rancher4SAP} *
** {sle_ha} **

+++*+++ The {rancher4SAP} subscription holds support for all required components like {slem}, {rancher} and {lh}.

+++**+++ Only needed if you want to set up {rancher} in a high availability setup

Additionally,

* check the storage requirements.

* create a or get access to a private container registry.

* get an SAP S-user ID to access software and documentation from SAP.

* read the relevant SAP documentation:

** https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839[Release Note for SAP Edge Integration Cell]

** https://me.sap.com/notes/2946788[Release Note for SAP ELM Bridge]

== Landscape Overview

To run {eic} in a production-ready and supported way, you need to set up multiple Kubernetes clusters and their nodes.
Those comprise a Kubernetes cluster where you will install {rancher} to set up and manage the production and non-production clusters.
For this {rancher} cluster, we recommend using three Kubernetes nodes and a load balancer.

The {eic} will need to run in a dedicated Kubernetes cluster.
For an HA setup of this cluster, we recommend using three Kubernetes control planes and three Kubernetes worker nodes.

For a graphical overview of what is needed, take a look at the landscape overview:

image::SAP-EIC-Architecture.svg[title=Architecture Overview,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

* The dark blue rectangles represent Kubernetes clusters.
* The olive rectangles represent Kubernetes nodes that hold the roles of Control Plane and Worker combined.
* The green rectangles represent Kubernetes Control Plane nodes.
* The orange rectangles represent Kubernetes Worker nodes.

We will use this graphic overview in the guide to illustrate what the next step is and what it is for.


Starting with installing the operating system of each machine or Kubernetes node, we will walk you through all the steps you need to take to get a fully set-up Kubernetes landscape for deploying {eic}.

== Installing {slem} {slem_version}
There are several ways to install {slem} {slem_version}. For this best practice guide, we use the installation method via graphical installer. But in cloud-native deployments it is highly recommended to use Infrastructure-as-Code technologies to fully automate the deployment and lifecycle processes.

== Installing {rancher} cluster

By now you should have installed the operating system on every Kubernetes node.
You are now ready to install a {rancher} cluster.
Taking a look again on the landscape overview, this means, we will now cover how to set up the upper part of the given graphic:

== Installing RKE2 using {rancher}

After having installed the {rancher} cluster, you can now use it to create the {rke} clusters for {eic}.
SAP recommends to set up not only a production landscape, but to have  QA / Dev systems for {eic}. Both can be set up the same way using {rancher}.
How to do this is covered in this chapter.
Returning to the landscape overview, we will now focus on setting up the lower part of the graphic below:

== Preparing storage

To make storage available for Kubernetes workloads, prepare the storage solution you want to use.
In this chapter, we will describe how to set this up and how to prepare it for consumption by {eic}.

The storage solutions tested by SAP and SUSE are presented below, along with links to chapters detailing their setup and configuration.

== Installing {metallb} and databases

In the following chapter we present an example for setting up {metallb}, {redis} and {pg}.

NOTE: Keep in mind that the descriptions and instructions below might differ from the deployment you need for your specific infrastructure and use cases.

=== Logging in to {rac}

To access the {rac}, you need to log in. You can do this using the console and Helm client.
The easiest way to do so is to use the built-in shell in {rancher}. To access it, navigate to your cluster and click *Kubectl Shell* as shown below:

image::EIC-Rancher-Kubectl-Button.png[title=Rancher Shell Access,scaledwidth=99%]

A shell will open as shown in the image below:

image::EIC-Rancher-Kubectl-Shell.png[title=Rancher Shell Overview,scaledwidth=99%]


You must log in to {rac}. This can be done as follows:

[source, bash]
----
helm registry login dp.apps.rancher.io/charts -u <yourUser> -p <your-token>
----


=== Installing {metallb} on Kubernetes cluster

The following chapter should guide you through the installation and configuration of {metallb} on your Kubernetes cluster used for {eic}.

include::SAP-EIC-Metallb.adoc[Metallb, leveloffset=2]


=== Installing {redis}

// https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/prepare-your-kubernetes-cluster#redis-data-store-requirements

Before deploying {redis}, ensure that the requirements described at
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839 are met.

Also, make sure you understand what grade of persistence you want to achieve for your {redis} cluster.
For more information about persistence in {redis}, see
https://redis.io/docs/management/persistence/.


include::SAP-EIC-Redis.adoc[leveloffset=2]


=== Installing {pg}

// https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/prepare-your-kubernetes-cluster#postgresql-database-requirements

Before deploying {pg}, ensure that the requirements described at
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839 are met.

== Installing {eic}

// include::SAP-EIC.adoc[]
At this point, you should be able to deploy {eic}.
Follow the instructions at https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/setting-up-and-managing-edge-integration-cell
to install {eic} in your prepared environments.

=== Using self-signed certificates

In this chapter we will explain how to create self-signed certificates and how to make them available within Kubernetes. We will describe two possible solutions to do this. You can create everything on the operation system layer or you also can use cert-manager in your downstream cluster.

include::SAP-EIC-General.adoc[tags=self-signed-certificates]

You should then have the files _server.pem_, _server.key_ and _chained.pem_ that can be used for your applications such as Redis or PostgresSQL.
