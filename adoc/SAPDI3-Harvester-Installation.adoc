[#Harvester-Installation]

== Installing SUSE Rancher Harvester

=== Introduction

Harvester is the open source Hyper Converged Infrastructure (HCI) solution running on Kubernetes, {lh} and Kubevirt.
Harvester provides the ability to provision, manage and run virtual machines. 

=== Prerequisites

Depending on the purpose of the Harvester installation (development, testing or productive use), one or more (virtual) machines are needed.
At the time of writing, the system architecture is x86_64 only.
For the Harvester deployment, the following information should be handy:


* IP addresses for the hosts running Harvester
* IP address to be used as management address
* Gateway address
* IP address of name server
* Access to a time server
* Access to the Internet (for air-gapped installations see: https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/airgap)

For more information, see the product documentation for Harvester:
https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1/


=== Preparing the installation

Before the installation of Harvester can be started, the following steps should be performed:

* Download installation media as needed https://github.com/harvester/harvester/releases
* Prepare hardware to run the Harvester installation on, for example, mount the ISO file.
* Network setup (IP addresses, VLAN)


=== Installing Harvester

The installation of Harvester is straight forward:

* Boot the machines dedicated to the Harvester cluster from the installation media.
* After booting the machine, a guided setup leads you through the installation.

* Provide the following information:

** Device where the installation is targeted to

** Host name
** IP address 
** Network interface to be used 
** Gateway

** DNS servers

** Management IP address

** Define cluster token. This is needed when joining other Harvester nodes.

** Set the node shell access password. Default user is "rancher".

** Configure the time server.

** Proxy servers (optional) are being entered.

Finally, a review panel is displayed.

Confirm the configuration. The installation will start.

When the installation is finished, you will see the following screen:

This means that Harvester is up and running. Be patient as it can take some minutes.

For more installation options, see the Harvester documentation at https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.1


For productive environments, it is recommended to set up a Harvester cluster consisting of at least three nodes (or a higher odd number).
To join nodes to the existing Harvester installation, simply select "Join existing Harvester cluster" after booting the node from the installation media.

For the installation workflow described, the following information is needed in addition:

* the management VIP

* the cluster token

=== Accessing the management UI

The Harvester HCI is managed via a Web UI:

* Use the management (VIP) address to access the Harvester UI via an Internet browser. Next, set up the administrative account for Harvester.

* After logging in, the Harvester Cluster overview dashboard is displayed.

// /* ==== Creating network settings

//==== Importing OS images for VMs

//From the main menu  choose Images, then click on the create button.
//The image needs to have a name and an optional description
//There two ways  to import an OS image, either by download from an internet source or by uploading a file from local computer.
//Finally click the save button.
//The image will be stored for later use in Harvester.

//==== Creating VM

//Virtual machines are created by selecting the virtual machine item from menu list and clicking create.

//* Give a unique name to the VM 
//* select the cpu count
//* select the size of RAM
//* define the disk size and number of disks
//* select network and access method (masquerade or bridged, this depends on the Harvester network configuration)

//Start VM deployment by clicking the save button.
