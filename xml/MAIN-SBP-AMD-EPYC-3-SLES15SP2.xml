    <title>Overview</title>

    <para>The AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor is the latest generation of the AMD64 System-on-Chip
      (SoC) processor family. It is based on the Zen 3 microarchitecture introduced in 2020,
      supporting up to 64 cores (128 threads) and 8 memory channels per socket. At the time of
      writing, 1-socket and 2-socket models are available from Original Equipment Manufacturers
      (OEMs). This document provides an overview of the AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor and how
      computational-intensive workloads can be tuned on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2.</para>
  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="sec-epyc-architecture">
    <title>AMD EPYC 7003 Series Processor architecture</title>

    <para><emphasis role="italic">Symmetric multiprocessing (SMP)</emphasis> systems are those that
      contain two or more physical processing cores. Each core may have two threads if Symmetric
      Multi-Threading (SMT) is enabled with some resources being shared between SMT siblings. To
      minimize access latencies, multiple layers of caches are used with each level being larger but
      with higher access costs. Cores may share different levels of cache which should be considered
      when tuning for a workload.</para>

    <para>Historically, a single socket contained several cores sharing a hierarchy of caches and
      memory channels and multiple sockets were connected via a memory interconnect. Modern
      configurations may have multiple dies as a <emphasis role="italic">Multi-Chip Module
        (MCM)</emphasis> with one set of interconnects within the socket and a separate interconnect
      for each socket. In practical terms, it means that some CPUs and memory are faster to access
      than others depending on the <quote>distance</quote>. This should be considered when tuning
      for <emphasis role="italic">Non-Uniform Memory Architecture (NUMA)</emphasis> as all memory
      accesses may not reference local memory incurring a variable access penalty.</para>

    <para>The 3rd Generation AMD EPYC processor has an MCM design with up to nine dies on each
      package. From a topology point of view, this is significantly different to the 1st Generation
      AMD EPYC Processor design, but similar to the 2nd Generation AMD EPYC Processor. One die is a
      central IO die through which all off-chip communication passes through. The basic building
      block of a compute die is an eight-core Core CompleX (CCX) with its own L1-L3 cache hierarchy.
      This is double the number of cores relative to the 2nd Generation AMD EPYC Processor with the
      L3 cache size increasing from 16MB to 32MB to compensate. One Core Complex Die (CCD) consists
      of one CCX with an Infinity Link to the IO die, as opposed to two CCXs used in the 2nd
      Generation AMD EPYC Processor. This change in topology allowed the 3rd Generation AMD EPYC
      Processors to communicate directly within a CCD instead of using the IO link, thus reducing
      communication latency and overall effective memory access latency. A 64-core 3rd Generation
      AMD EPYC Processor socket therefore consists of 8 CCDs consisting of 8 CCXs or 64 cores in
      total (128 CPUs with SMP enabled) with one additional IO die for 9 dies in total.</para>

    <para>Communication between the chip and memory happens via the IO die. Each CCD has one
      dedicated Infinity Fabric link to the die and two memory channels per CCD located on the die.
      The practical consequence of this architecture versus the 1st Generation AMD EPYC Processor is
      that the topology is simpler. The first generation had separate memory channels per die and
      links between dies giving two levels of NUMA distance within a single socket and a third
      distance when communicating between sockets. This meant that a two-socket machine for EPYC had
      4 NUMA nodes (3 levels of NUMA distance). The 2nd Generation AMD EPYC Processor has only 2
      NUMA nodes (2 levels of NUMA distance) which makes it easier to tune and optimize. The NUMA
      distances are the same for the 3rd Generation AMD EPYC Processor. The main difference to the
      2nd Generation AMD Processor is that communication latencies within a CCD are reduced.</para>

    <para>The IO die has a total of 8 memory controllers, each with 2 channels supporting one DDR4
        <emphasis role="italic">Dual Inline Memory Modules (DIMMs)</emphasis> each (16 DIMMs in
      total). With a peak DDR4 frequency of 3.2 GHz, this yields a total of 204.8 GB/sec peak
      theoretical bandwidth. The exact bandwidth, however, depends on the DIMMs selected, the number
      of memory channels populated, and the efficiency of the application. The maximum total
      capacity is 4 TB.</para>

    <para>Power management on the links is careful to minimize the amount of power required. If the
      links are idle, the power may be used to boost the frequency of individual cores. Hence,
      minimizing access is not only important from a memory access latency point of view, but it
      also has an impact on the speed of individual cores.</para>

    <para>There are eight IO x16 PCIe 4.0 lanes per socket where lanes can be used as Infinity
      links, PCI Express links or SATA links with a limit of 32 SATA or NVMe devices. This allows
      very large IO configurations and a high degree of flexibility given that either IO bandwidth
      or the bandwidth between sockets can be optimized, depending on the OEM requirements. The most
      likely configuration is that the number of PCIe links will be the same for 1 and socket
      machines given that some lanes per socket will be used for inter-socket communication. The
      upshot is that a 1 or 2 socket configuration does not need to compromise on the available IO
      channels. The exact configuration used depends on the platform.</para>

    <para>This tool is part of the <package>hwloc</package>. The two <quote>packages</quote>
      correspond to each socket. The CCXs consisting of 8 cores (16 threads) each should be clear,
      as each CCX has one L3 cache. Not obvious are the links to the IO die, but the IO die should
      be taken into account when splitting a workload to optimize bandwidth to memory. In this
      example, the IO channels are not heavily used, but the focus will be on CPU and
      memory-intensive loads. If optimizing for IO, it is recommended that, where possible, the
      workload is located on the nodes local to the IO channel.</para>

    <para>The computer output below shows a conventional view of the topology using the
        <package>numactl</package> tool which is slightly edited for clarity. The CPU IDs that map
      to each node are reported on the <quote>node X cpus:</quote> lines and note the NUMA distances
      on the table at the bottom of the computer output. Node 0 and node 1 are a distance of 32
      apart as they are on separate sockets. The distance is a not a guarantee of the access
      latency. But it is a rule of thumb that accesses between sockets are roughly three times the
      cost of accessing another die on the same socket.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="sec-memory-cpu-binding">
    <title>Memory and CPU binding</title>

    <para>NUMA is a scalable memory architecture for multiprocessor systems that can reduce
      contention on a memory channel. A full discussion on tuning for NUMA is beyond the scope for
      this document. But the document <quote>A NUMA API for Linux</quote> at <link
        xlink:href="http://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/LibNUMA-WP-fv1.pdf"
        >http://developer.amd.com/wordpress/media/2012/10/LibNUMA-WP-fv1.pdf</link> provides a
      valuable introduction.</para>

    <para>The default policy for programs is the <quote>local policy</quote>. A program which calls
        <command>malloc()</command> or <command>mmap()</command> reserves virtual address space but
      does not immediately allocate physical memory. The physical memory is allocated the first time
      the address is accessed by any thread and, if possible, the memory will be local to the
      accessing CPU. If the mapping is of a file, the first access may have occurred at any time in
      the past so there are no guarantees about locality.</para>

    <para>When memory is allocated to a node, it is less likely to move if a thread changes to a CPU
      on another node or if multiple programs are remote-accessing the data unless <emphasis
        role="italic">Automatic NUMA Balancing (NUMAB)</emphasis> is enabled. When NUMAB is enabled,
      unbound process accesses are sampled. If there are enough remote accesses then the data will
      be migrated to local memory. This mechanism is not perfect and incurs overhead of its own.
      This can be important for performance for thread and process migrations between nodes to be
      minimized and for memory placement to be carefully considered and tuned.</para>

    <para>The <package>taskset</package> tool is used to set or get the CPU affinity for new or
      existing processes. An example usage is to confine a new process to CPUs local to one node.
      Where possible, local memory will be used. But if the total required memory is larger than the
      node, then remote memory can still be used. In such configurations, it is recommended to size
      the workload such that it fits in the node. This avoids that any of the data is being paged
      out when <package>kswapd</package> wakes to reclaim memory from the local node.</para>

    <para><package>numactl</package> controls both memory and CPU policies for processes that it
      launches and can modify existing processes. In many respects, the parameters are easier to
      specify than <package>taskset</package>. For example, it can bind a task to all CPUs on a
      specified node instead of having to specify individual CPUs with <package>taskset</package>.
      Most importantly, it can set the memory allocation policy without requiring application
      awareness.</para>

    <para>Using policies, a preferred node can be specified where the task will use that node if
      memory is available. This is typically used in combination with binding the task to CPUs on
      that node. If a workload's memory requirements are larger than a single node and predictable
      performance is required, then the <quote>interleave</quote> policy will round-robin
      allocations from allowed nodes. This gives suboptimal but predictable access latencies to main
      memory. More importantly, interleaving reduces the probability that the operating system (OS)
      will need to reclaim any data belonging to a large task.</para>

    <para>Further improvements can be made to access latencies by binding a workload to a single
        <emphasis role="italic">Core Complex Die (CCD)</emphasis> within a node. Since L3 caches are
      now shared within a CCD, binding a workload to a CCD avoids L3 cache misses caused by workload
      migration. This is an important difference since the 2nd Generation AMD EPYC Processor which
      aimed to bind within a CCX.</para>

    <para>Find examples below on how <package>taskset</package> and <package>numactl</package> can
      be used to start commands bound to different CPUs depending on the topology.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec-tuning-without-binding">
      <title>Tuning for local access without binding</title>

      <para>The ability to use local memory where possible and remote memory if necessary is
        valuable. But there are cases where it is imperative that local memory always be used. If
        this is the case, the first priority is to bind the task to that node. If that is not
        possible then the command <command>sysctl vm.zone_reclaim_mode=1</command> can be used to
        aggressively reclaim memory if local memory is not available. </para>

      <note>
        <title>High costs</title>

        <para>While this option is good from a locality perspective, it can incur high costs because
          of stalls related to reclaim and the possibility that data from the task will be
          reclaimed. Treat this option with a high degree of caution and testing.</para>
      </note>
    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec-hazards-cpu-binding">
      <title>Hazards with CPU binding</title>

      <para>There are three major hazards to consider with CPU binding.</para>

      <para>The first is to watch for remote memory nodes being used where the process is not
        allowed to run on CPUs local to that node. Going more in detail here is outside the scope of
        this paper. However, the most common scenario is an IO-bound thread communicating with a
        kernel IO thread on a remote node bound to the IO controller whose accesses are never
        local.</para>

      <para>While tasks may be bound to CPUs, the resources they are accessing such as network or
        storage devices may not have interrupts routed locally. <package>irqbalance</package>
        generally makes good decisions. But in cases where network or IO is extremely high
        performance or the application has very low latency requirements, it may be necessary to
        disable <package>irqbalance</package> using <command>systemctl</command>. When that is done,
        the IRQs for the target device need to be routed manually to CPUs local to the target
        workload for optimal performance.</para>

      <para>The second is that guides about CPU binding tend to focus on binding to a single CPU.
        This is not always optimal when the task communicates with other threads, as fixed bindings
        potentially miss an opportunity for the processes to use idle cores sharing an L1 or L2
        cache. This is particularly true when dispatching IO, be it to disk or a network interface
        where a task may benefit from being able to migrate close to the related threads but also
        applies to pipeline-based communicating threads for a computational workload. Hence, focus
        initially on binding to CPUs sharing L3 cache. Then consider whether to bind based on a
        L1/L2 cache or a single CPU using the primary metric of the workload to establish whether
        the tuning is appropriate. </para>

      <para>The final hazard is similar: if many tasks are bound to a smaller set of CPUs, then the
        subset of CPUs could be over-saturated even though the machine overall has spare
        capacity.</para>

    </sect2>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec-cpusets-memory-control-groups">
      <title>CPUsets and memory control groups</title>

      <para><emphasis role="italic">CPUsets</emphasis> are ideal when multiple workloads must be
        isolated on a machine in a predictable fashion. CPUsets allow a machine to be partitioned
        into subsets. These sets may overlap, and in that case they suffer from similar problems as
        CPU affinities. In the event there is no overlap, they can be switched to
          <quote>exclusive</quote> mode which treats them completely in isolation with relatively
        little overhead. Similarly, they are well suited when a primary workload must be protected
        from interference because of low-priority tasks in which case the low priority tasks can be
        placed in a CPUset. The caveat with CPUsets is that the overhead is higher than using
        scheduler and memory policies. Ordinarily, the accounting code for CPUsets is completely
        disabled. But when a single CPUset is created, there is a second layer of checks against
        scheduler and memory policies.</para>

      <para>Similarly <package>memcg</package> can be used to limit the amount of memory that can be
        used by a set of processes. When the limits are exceeded then the memory will be reclaimed
        by tasks within <package>memcg</package> directly without interfering with any other tasks.
        This is ideal for ensuring there is no inference between two or more sets of tasks. Similar
        to CPUsets, there is some management overhead incurred. This means if tasks can simply be
        isolated on a NUMA boundary then this is preferred from a performance perspective. The major
        hazard is that, if the limits are exceeded, then the processes directly stall to reclaim the
        memory which can incur significant latencies. </para>

      <note>
        <title/>

        <para>Without <package>memcg</package>, when memory gets low, the global reclaim daemon does
          work in the background and if it reclaims quickly enough, no stalls are incurred. When
          using <package>memcg</package>, observe the <package>allocstall</package> counter in
            <filename>/proc/vmstat</filename> as this can detect early if stalling is a
          problem.</para>

  <sect1 xml:id="sec-hp-storage-interrupt-affinity">
    <title>High performance storage devices and interrupt affinity</title>

    <para>High performance storage devices like <emphasis role="italic">Non-Volatile Memory Express
        (NVMe)</emphasis> or <emphasis role="italic">Serial Attached SCSI (SAS)</emphasis>
      controller are designed to take advantage of parallel IO submission. These devices typically
      support a large number of submit and receive queues, which are tied to <emphasis role="italic"
        >MSI-X</emphasis> interrupts. Ideally these devices should provide as many MSI-X vectors as
      CPUs are in the system. To achieve the best performance each MSI-X vector should be assigned
      to an individual CPU.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="sec-auto-numa-balancing">
    <title>Automatic NUMA balancing</title>

    <para>Automatic NUMA Balancing will ignore any task that uses memory policies. If the workloads
      can be manually optimized with policies, then do so and disable automatic NUMA balancing by
      specifying <command>numa_balancing=disable</command> on the kernel command line or via
        <command>sysctl</command>. There are many cases where it is impractical or impossible to
      specify policies in which case the balancing should be sufficient for throughput-sensitive
      workloads. For latency sensitive workloads, the sampling for NUMA balancing may be too high in
      which case it may be necessary to disable balancing. The final corner case where NUMA
      balancing is a hazard is a case where the number of runnable tasks always exceeds the number
      of CPUs in a single node. In this case, the load balancer (and potentially affine wakes) will
      constantly pull tasks away from the preferred node as identified by automatic NUMA balancing
      resulting in excessive sampling and CPU migrations.</para>

  </sect1>

  <sect1 xml:id="sec-evaluating-_workloads">
    <title>Evaluating workloads</title>

    <para>The first and foremost step when evaluating how a workload should be tuned is to establish
      a primary metric such as latency, throughput or elapsed time. When each tuning step is
      considered or applied, it is critical that the primary metric be examined before conducting
      any further analysis to avoid intensive focus on the wrong bottleneck. Make sure that the
      metric is measured multiple times to ensure that the result is reproducible and reliable
      within reasonable boundaries. When that is established, analyse how the workload is using
      different system resources to determine what area should be the focus. The focus in this paper
      is on how CPU and memory is used. But other evaluations may need to consider the IO subsystem,
      network subsystem, system call interfaces, external libraries etc. The methodologies that can
      be employed to conduct this are outside the scope of the paper but the book <quote>Systems
        Performance: Enterprise and the Cloud</quote> by Brendan Gregg (see <link
        xlink:href="http://www.brendangregg.com/systems-performance-2nd-edition-book.html"
        >http://www.brendangregg.com/systems-performance-2nd-edition-book.html</link>) is a
      recommended primer on the subject.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec-cpu-utilization-saturation">
      <title>CPU utilization and saturation</title>

      <para>Decisions on whether to bind a workload to a subset of CPUs require that the CPU

        then they are not contributing to utilization. The <command>mpstat</command> command can
        report the utilization of each CPU in the system. </para>

      <para>High utilization of a small subset of CPUs may be indicative of a single-threaded
        workload that is pushing the CPU to the limits and may indicate a bottleneck. Conversely,
        low utilization may indicate a task that is not CPU-bound, is idling frequently or is
        migrating excessively. While each workload is different, load utilization of CPUs may show a
        workload that can run on a subset of CPUs to reduce latencies because of either migrations
        or remote accesses. When utilization is high, it is important to determine if the system
        could be saturated. The <package>vmstat</package> tool reports the number of runnable tasks
        waiting for CPU in the <quote>r</quote> column where any value over 1 indicates that wakeup
        latencies may be incurred. While the exact wakeup latency can be calculated using trace
        points, knowing that there are tasks queued is an important step. If a system is saturated,
        it may be possible to tune the workload to use fewer threads.</para>

      <para>Overall, the initial intent should be to use CPUs from as few NUMA nodes as possible to
        reduce access latency but there are exceptions. The AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor has an
        exceptional number of high-speed memory channels to main memory. Thus consider the workload
        thread activity. If they are co-operating threads or sharing data, isolate them on as few
        nodes as possible to minimize cross-node memory accesses. If the threads are completely
        independent with no shared data, it may be best to isolate them on a subset of CPUs from
        each node. This is to maximize the number of available memory channels and throughput to
        main memory. For some computational workloads, it may be possible to use hybrid models such
        as MPI for parallelization across nodes and using openMP for threads within nodes.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec-transparent-huge-pages">
      <title>Transparent Huge Pages</title>

      <para>Huge pages are a mechanism by which performance can be improved. This is done by
        reducing the number of page faults, the cost of translating virtual addresses to physical
        addresses because of fewer layers in the page table and being able to cache translations for
        a larger portion of memory. <emphasis role="italic">Transparent Huge Pages (THP)</emphasis>
        is supported for private anonymous memory that automatically backs mappings with huge pages
        where anonymous memory could be allocated as <command>heap</command>,
          <command>malloc()</command>, <command>mmap(MAP_ANONYMOUS)</command>, etc. While the
        feature has existed for a long time, it has evolved significantly.</para>

      <para>Many tuning guides recommend disabling THP because of problems with early
        implementations. Specifically, when the machine was running for long enough, the use of THP
        could incur severe latencies and could aggressively reclaim memory in certain circumstances.
        These problems have been resolved by the time SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 was
        released. This means there are no good grounds for automatically disabling THP because of
        severe latency issues without measuring the impact. However, there are exceptions that are
        worth considering for specific workloads.</para>

      <para>Some high-end in-memory databases and other applications aggressively use
          <command>mprotect()</command> to ensure that unprivileged data is never leaked. If these
        protections are at the base page granularity then there may be many THP splits and rebuilds
        that incur overhead. It can be identified if this is a potential problem by using
          <command>strace</command> to detect the frequency and granularity of the system call. If
        they are high frequency then consider disabling THP. It can also be sometimes inferred from
        observing the <command>thp_split</command> and <command>thp_collapse_alloc</command>
        counters in <filename>/proc/vmstat</filename>.</para>

      <para>Workloads that sparsely address large mappings may have a higher memory footprint when
        using THP. This could result in premature reclaim or fallback to remote nodes. An example
        would be HPC workloads operating on large sparse matrices. If memory usage is much higher
        than expected then compare memory usage with and without THP to decide if the trade off is
        not worthwhile. This may be critical on the AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor given that any
        spillover will congest the Infinity links and potentially cause cores to run at a lower
        frequency. </para>

      <note>
        <title>Sparsely addressed memory</title>
        <para>This is specific to sparsely addressed memory. A secondary hint for this case may be
          that the application primarily uses large mappings with a much higher Virtual Size (VSZ,
          see <xref linkend="sec-memory-utilization-saturation"/>) than Resident Set Size (RSS).
          Applications which densely address memory benefit from the use of THP by achieving greater
          bandwidth to memory.</para>
      </note>

      <para>Parallelized workloads that operate on shared buffers with threads using more CPUs that
        are on a single node may experience a slowdown with THP if the granularity of partitioning
        is not aligned to the huge page. The problem is that if a large shared buffer is partitioned
        on a 4K boundary then false sharing may occur whereby one thread accesses a huge page
        locally and other threads access it remotely. If this situation is encountered, it is
        preferable that the granularity of sharing is increased to the THP size. But if that is not
        possible then disabling THP is an option.</para>

      <para>Applications that are extremely latency sensitive or must always perform in a
        deterministic fashion can be hindered by THP. While there are fewer faults, the time for
        each fault is higher as memory must be allocated and cleared before being visible. The
        increase in fault times may be in the microsecond granularity. Ensure this is a relevant
        problem as it typically only applies to extremely latency-sensitive applications. The
        secondary problem is that a kernel daemon periodically scans a process looking for
        contiguous regions that can be backed by huge pages. When creating a huge page, there is a
        window during which that memory cannot be accessed by the application and new mappings
        cannot be created until the operation is complete. This can be identified as a problem with
        thread-intensive applications that frequently allocate memory. In this case consider
        effectively disabling <package>khugepaged</package> by setting a large value in
          <filename>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/khugepaged/alloc_sleep_millisecs</filename>.
        This will still allow THP to be used opportunistically while avoiding stalls when calling
          <command>malloc()</command> or <command>mmap()</command>.</para>

      <para>THP can be disabled. To do so, specify <command>transparent_hugepage=disable</command>
        on the kernel command line, at runtime via
          <filename>/sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled</filename> or on a per process basis
        by using a wrapper to execute the workload that calls
          <command>prctl(PR_SET_THP_DISABLE)</command>.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec-user-kernel-footprint">
      <title>User/kernel footprint</title>

      <para>Assuming an application is mostly CPU or memory bound, it is useful to determine if the
        footprint is primarily in user space or kernel space. This gives a hint where tuning should
        be focused. The percentage of CPU time can be measured on a coarse-grained fashion using
          <command>vmstat</command> or a fine-grained fashion using <command>mpstat</command>. If an
        application is mostly spending time in user space then the focus should be on tuning the
        application itself. If the application is spending time in the kernel then it should be
        determined which subsystem dominates. The <command>strace</command> or <command>perf
          trace</command> commands can measure the type, frequency and duration of system calls as
        they are the primary reasons an application spends time within the kernel. In some cases, an
        application may be tuned or modified to reduce the frequency and duration of system calls.
        In other cases, a profile is required to identify which portions of the kernel are most
        relevant as a target for tuning.</para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec-memory-utilization-saturation">
      <title>Memory utilization and saturation</title>

      <para>The traditional means of measuring memory utilization of a workload is to examine the
          <emphasis role="italic">Virtual Size (VSZ)</emphasis> and <emphasis role="italic">Resident
          Set Size (RSS)</emphasis> using either the <command>ps</command> or
          <command>pidstat</command> tool. This is a reasonable first step but is potentially
        misleading when shared memory is used and multiple processes are examined. VSZ is simply a
        measure of memory space reservation and is not necessarily used. RSS may be double accounted
        if it is a shared segment between multiple processes. The file
          <filename>/proc/pid/maps</filename> can be used to identify all segments used and whether
        they are private or shared. The file <filename>/proc/pid/smaps</filename> yields more
        detailed information including the <emphasis role="italic">Proportional Set Size
          (PSS)</emphasis>. PSS is an estimate of RSS except it is divided between the number of
        processes mapping that segment which can give a more accurate estimate of utilization. Note
        that the <filename>smaps</filename> file is very expensive to read and should not be
        monitored at a high frequency. Finally, the <emphasis role="italic">Working Set Size
          (WSS)</emphasis> is the amount of memory active required to complete computations during
        an arbitrary phase of a programs execution. It is not a value that can be trivially
        measured. But conceptually it is useful as the interaction between WSS relative to available
        memory affects memory residency and page fault rates.</para>

      <para>On NUMA systems, the first saturation point is a node overflow when the
          <quote>local</quote> policy is in effect. Given no binding of memory, when a node is
        filled, a remote node’s memory will be used transparently and background reclaim will take
        place on the local node. Two consequences of this are that remote access penalties will be
        used and old memory from the local node will be reclaimed. If the WSS of the application
        exceeds the size of a local node then paging and re-faults may be incurred.</para>

      <para>The first thing to identify is that a remote node overflow occurred which is accounted
        for in <filename>/proc/vmstat</filename> as the <command>numa_hit</command>,
          <command>numa_miss</command>, <command>numa_foreign</command>,
          <command>numa_interleave</command>, <command>numa_local</command> and <command>numa_other
          counters</command>:</para>

      <itemizedlist>
        <listitem>
          <para><command>numa_hit</command> is incremented when an allocation uses the preferred
            node where preferred may be either a local node or one specified by a memory
            policy.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><command>numa_miss</command> is incremented when an alternative node is used to

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><command>numa_foreign</command> is rarely useful but is accounted against a node
            that was preferred. It is a subtle distinction from numa_miss that is rarely
            useful.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><command>numa_interleave</command> is incremented when an interleave policy was used
            to select allowed nodes in a round-robin fashion.</para>
        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><command>numa_local</command> increments when a local node is used for an allocation

        </listitem>
        <listitem>
          <para><command>numa_other</command> is used when a remote node is used for an allocation
            regardless of policy.</para>
        </listitem>
      </itemizedlist>

      <para>For the local memory policy, the <command>numa_hit</command> and
          <command>numa_miss</command> counters are the most important to pay attention to. An
        application that is allocating memory that starts incrementing the
          <command>numa_miss</command> implies that the first level of saturation has been reached.
        If monitoring the <filename>proc</filename> is undesirable then the
          <command>numastat</command> provides the same information. If this is observed on the AMD
        EPYC 7003 Series Processor, it may be valuable to bind the application to nodes that
        represent dies on a single socket. If the ratio of hits to misses is close to 1, consider an
        evaluation of the interleave policy to avoid unnecessary reclaim.</para>

      <note>
        <title>NUMA statistics</title>

        <para>These NUMA statistics only apply at the time a physical page is allocated and is not
          related to the reference behaviour of the workload. For example, if a task running on node
          0 allocates memory local to node 0 then it will be accounted for as a
            <command>node_hit</command> in the statistics. However, if the memory is shared with a
          task running on node 1, all the accesses may be remote, which is a miss from the
          perspective of the hardware but not accounted for in <filename>/proc/vmstat</filename>.
          Detecting remote and local accesses at a hardware level requires using the hardware's
            <emphasis role="italic">Performance Management Unit</emphasis> to detect.</para>
      </note>

      <para>When the first saturation point is reached then reclaim will be active. This can be
        observed by monitoring the <command>pgscan_kswapd</command> and
          <command>pgsteal_kswapd</command>
        <filename>/proc/vmstat counters</filename>. If this is matched with an increase in major
        faults or minor faults then it may be indicative of severe thrashing. In this case the
        interleave policy should be considered. An ideal tuning option is to identify if shared
        memory is the source of the usage. If this is the case, then interleave the shared memory
        segments. This can be done in some circumstances using <command>numactl</command> or by
        modifying the application directly.</para>

      <para>More severe saturation is observed if the <command>pgscan_direct</command> and
          <command>pgsteal_direct</command> counters are also increasing as these indicate that the
        application is stalling while memory is being reclaimed. If the application was bound to
        individual nodes, increasing the number of available nodes will alleviate the pressure. If
        the application is unbound, it indicates that the WSS of the workload exceeds all available
        memory. It can only be alleviated by tuning the application to use less memory or increasing
        the amount of RAM available.</para>

      <para>As before, whether to use memory nodes from one socket or two sockets depends on the
        application. If the individual processes are independent then either socket can be used. But
        where possible, keep communicating processes on the same socket to maximize memory
        throughput while minimizing the socket interconnect traffic.</para>

      <title>Other resources</title>

      <para>The analysis of other resources is outside the scope of this paper. However, a common
        scenario is that an application is IO-bound. A superficial check can be made using the
          <command>vmstat</command> tool. This tool checks what percentage of CPU time is spent idle
        combined with the number of processes that are blocked and the values in the <emphasis

        But this is a sufficient check to start with. </para>

    <title>Power management</title>

    <para>Modern CPUs balance power consumption and performance through <emphasis role="italic"
        >Performance States (P-States)</emphasis>. Low utilization workloads may use lower P-States
      to conserve power while still achieving acceptable performance. When a CPU is idle, lower
      power idle states <emphasis role="italic">(C-States)</emphasis> can be selected to further
      conserve power. However this comes with higher exit latencies when lower power states are
      selected. It is further complicated by the fact that, if individual cores are idle and running
      at low power, the additional power can be used to boost the performance of active cores. This
      means this scenario is not a straight-forward balance between power consumption and
      performance. More complexity is added on the AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor whereby spare
      power may be used to boost either cores or the Infinity links.</para>

    <para>The 3rd Generation AMD EPYC processor provides <emphasis role="italic">SenseMI</emphasis>
      which, among other capabilities, enables CPUs to make adjustments to voltage and frequency
      depending on the historical state of the CPU. There is a latency penalty when switching
      P-States, but the AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor is capable of fine-grained in the adjustments
      that can be made to reduce likelihood that the latency is a bottleneck. On SUSE Linux
      Enterprise Server, the AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor uses the <command>acpi_cpufreq</command>
      driver. This allows P-states to be configured to match requested performance. However, this is
      limited in terms of the full capabilities of the hardware. It cannot boost the frequency
      beyond the maximum stated frequencies, and if a target is specified, then the highest
      frequency below the target will be used. A special case is if the governor is set to <emphasis
        role="strong">performance</emphasis>. In this situation the hardware will use the highest
      available frequency in an attempt to work quickly and then return to idle.</para>

    <para>What should be determined is whether power management is likely to be a factor for a
      workload. One that is limited to a subset of active CPUs and nodes will have high enough
      utilization. This means that power management will not be active on those cores and no action
      is required. Hence, with CPU binding, the issue of power management may be
      side-stepped.</para>

    <para>Secondly, a workload that does not communicate heavily with other processes and is mostly
      CPU-bound will also not experience any side effects because of power management.</para>

    <para>The workloads that are most likely to be affected are those that synchronously communicate
      between multiple threads or those that idle frequently and have low CPU utilization overall.
      It will be further compounded if the threads are sensitive to wakeup latency. However, there
      are secondary effects if a workload must complete quickly but the CPU is running at a low
      frequency.</para>

    <para>The P-State and C-State of each CPU can be examined using the <command>turbostat</command>
      utility. The computer output below shows an example, slightly edited to fit the page, where a
      workload is busy on CPU 0 and other workloads are idle. A useful exercise is to start a
      workload and monitor the output of <command>turbostat</command> paying close attention to CPUs
      that have moderate utilization and running at a lower frequency. If the workload is
      latency-sensitive, it is grounds for either minimizing the number of CPUs available to the
      workload or configuring power management. </para>

    <para>In the event it is determined that tuning CPU frequency management is appropriate. Then

      deemed to be necessary. Note that <command>turbostat</command> will still show that idling
      CPUs use a low frequency. The impact of the policy is that the highest P-State will be used as
      soon as possible when the CPU is active. In some cases, a latency bottleneck will occur
      because of a CPU exiting idle. If this is identified on the AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor,
      restrict the C-state by specifying <command>processor.max_cstate=2</command> on the kernel
      command line. This will prevent CPUs from entering lower C-states. It is expected on the AMD
      EPYC 7003 Series Processor that the exit latency from C1 is very low. But by allowing C2, it
      reduces interference from the idle loop injecting micro-operations into the pipeline and
      should be the best state overall. It is also possible to set the max idle state on individual
      cores using <command>cpupower idle-set</command>. If SMT is enabled, the idle state should be
      set on both siblings.</para>

    <para>The AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor has extensive Performance Monitoring Unit (PMU)

        <command>perf</command>. The command supports a range of hardware events including cycles,
      L1 cache access/misses, TLB access/misses, retired branch instructions and mispredicted
      branches. To identify what subsystem may be worth tuning in the OS, the most useful invocation
      is <command>perf record -a -e cycles sleep 30</command> to capture 30 seconds of data for the
      entire system. You can also call <command>perf record -e cycles command</command> to gather a
      profile of a given workload. Specific information on the OS can be gathered through
      tracepoints or creating probe points with <command>perf</command> or

      avoid unintended consequences when porting code that may affect the building and operation of

    <para>Fortunately, the add-on <package>Developer Tools Module</package> includes additional
      compilers with the latest version currently based on <package>GCC 10.2</package>. This
      compiler is capable of generating optimised code targeted at the 2nd Generation AMD EPYC
      processor and provides additional support for <package>OpenMP 5.0</package>. Unlike the system

      <title>Test workload: STREAM</title>

      <para><emphasis role="italic">STREAM</emphasis> is a memory bandwidth benchmark created by Dr.
        John D. McCalpin from the University of Virginia (for more information, see <link
          xlink:href="https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/"
          >https://www.cs.virginia.edu/stream/</link>. It can be used to measure bandwidth of each
        cache level and bandwidth to main memory while calculating four basic vector operations.
        Each operation can exhibit different throughputs to main memory depending on the locations
        and type of access.</para>

      <para>The benchmark was configured to run both single-threaded and parallelized with OpenMP to
        take advantage of multiple memory controllers. The array elements for the benchmark was set
        at 268,435,456 elements at compile time so each that array was 2048MB in size for a total
        memory footprint of approximately 6144 MB. The size was selected in line with the
        recommendation from STREAM that the array sizes be at least 4 times the total size of L3
        cache available in the system. An array-size offset was used so that the separate arrays for
        each parallelized thread would not share a Transparent Huge Page. The reason for that is
        that NUMA balancing may choose to migrate shared pages leading to some distortion of the
        results. </para>

      <para>Several options were considered for the test system that were unnecessary for STREAM
        running on the AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor but may be useful in other situations. STREAM
        performance can be limited if a load/store instruction stalls to fetch data. CPUs may
        automatically prefetch data based on historical behaviour but it is not guaranteed. In
        limited cases depending on the CPU and workload, this may be addressed by specifying
          <parameter>-fprefetch-loop-arrays</parameter> and depending on whether the workload is
        store-intensive, <parameter>-mprefetchwt1</parameter>. In the test system using AMD EPYC
        7003 Series processors, explicit prefetching did not help and was omitted. This is because
        an explicitly scheduled prefetch may disable a CPUs predictive algorithms and degrade
        performance. Similarly, for some workloads branch mispredictions can be a major problem, and
        in some cases breach mispredictions can be offset against I-Cache pressure by specifying
          <parameter>-funroll-loops</parameter>. In the case of STREAM on the test system, the CPU
        accurately predicted the branches rendering the unrolling of loops unnecessary. For
        math-intensive workloads it can be beneficial to link the application with
          <parameter>-lmvec</parameter> depending on the application. In the case of STREAM, the
        workload did not use significant math-based operations and so this option was not used. Some
        styles of code blocks and loops can also be optimized to use vectored operations by
        specifying <parameter>-ftree-vectorize</parameter> and explicitly adding support for CPU
        features such as <parameter>-mavx2</parameter>. In all cases, STREAM does not benefit as its
        operations are very basic. But it should be considered on an application-by-application
        basis and when building support libraries such as numerical libraries. In all cases,
        experimentation is recommended but caution advised, particularly when considering options
        like prefetch that may have been advisable on much older CPUs or completely different
        workloads. Such options are not universally beneficial or always suitable for modern CPUs
        such as the AMD EPYC 7003 Series processors.</para>

      <para>In the case of STREAM running on the AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor, it was sufficient
        to enable <parameter>-Ofast</parameter>. This includes the <parameter>-O3</parameter>
        optimizations to enable vectorization. In addition, it gives some leeway for optimizations
        that increase the code size with additional options for fast math that may not be
        standards-compliant.</para>

      <para>For OpenMP, the <parameter>SPREAD</parameter> option was used to spread the load across
        L3 caches. Spreading across memory controllers may have been more optimal but that
        information is not easily discoverable. OpenMP has a variety of different placement options
        if manually tuning placement. But careful attention should be paid to
          <parameter>OMP_PLACES</parameter> given the importance of the L3 Cache topology in AMD
        EPYC 7003 Series Processors. At the time of writing, it is not possible to specify
          <parameter>l3cache</parameter> as a place similar to what MPI has. In this case, the
        topology will need to be examined either with library support such as
          <package>hwloc</package>, directly via the <parameter>sysfs</parameter> or manually. While
        it is possible to guess via the CPUID, it is not recommended as CPUs may be offlined or the
        enumeration may change. An example specification of places based on L3 cache for the test

      <para><xref linkend="fig-stream_results"/> shows the reported bandwidth for the single and
        parallelized case. The single-threaded bandwidth for the basic Copy vector operation on a
        single core was 39.5 GB/sec. This is higher than the theoretical maximum of a single DIMM,
        but the IO die may interleave accesses. Channels are interleaved in this configuration. This
        has been recommended as the best balance for a variety of workloads but limits the absolute
        maximum of a specialized benchmark like STREAM. The total throughput for each parallel
        operation ranged from 173 GB/sec to 263 GB/sec depending on the type of operation and how
        efficiently memory bandwidth was used.</para>

        <title>STREAM scores</title>

        <para>Higher STREAM scores can be reported by reducing the array sizes so that cache is
          partially used with the maximum score requiring that each threads memory footprint fits
          inside the L1 cache. Additionally, it is possible to achieve results closer to the
          theoretical maximum by manual optimization of the STREAM benchmark using vectored
          instructions and explicit scheduling of loads and stores. The purpose of this
          configuration was to illustrate the impact of properly binding a workload that can be
          fully parallelized with data-independent threads.</para>

      <title>Test workload: NASA Parallel Benchmark</title>

      <para><emphasis role="italic">NASA Parallel Benchmark (NPB)</emphasis> is a small set of
        compute-intensive kernels designed to evaluate the performance of supercomputers. They are
        small compute kernels derived from <emphasis role="italic">Computational Fluid Dynamics
          (CFD)</emphasis> applications. The problem size can be adjusted for different memory
        sizes. Reference implementations exist for both MPI and OpenMP. This setup will focus on the
        MPI reference implementation.</para>

      <para>While each application behaves differently, one common characteristic is that the
        workload is very context-switch intensive, barriers frequently yield the CPU to other tasks
        and the lifetime of individual processes can be very short-lived. The following paragraphs
        detail the tuning selected for this workload.</para>

      <para>The most basic step is setting the CPU governor to <quote>performance</quote> although
        it is not mandatory. This can address issues with short-lived, or mobile tasks, failing to
        run long enough for a higher P-State to be selected even though the workload is very
        throughput sensitive. The migration cost parameter is set to reduce the frequency the load
        balancer will move an individual task. The minimum granularity is adjusted to reduce
        over-scheduling effects. </para>

      <para>Depending on the computational kernel used, the workload may require a power-of-two
        number or a square number of processes to be used. However, note that using all available
        CPUs can mean that the application can contend with itself for CPU time. Furthermore, as IO
        may be issued to shared memory backed by disk, there are system threads that also need CPU
        time. Finally, if there is CPU contention, MPI tasks can be stalled waiting on an available
        CPU and OpenMPI may yield tasks prematurely if it detects there are more MPI tasks than CPUs
        available. These factors should be carefully considered when tuning for parallelized
        workloads in general and MPI workloads in particular.</para>

      <para>In the specific case of testing NPB on the System Under Test, there was usually limited
        advantage to limiting the number of CPUs used. For the <emphasis role="italics"
          >Embarrassingly Parallel (EP)</emphasis> load in particular, it benefits from using all
        available CPUs. Hence, the default configuration used all available CPUs (256) which is both
        a power-of-two and square number of CPUs because it was a sensible starting point. However,
        this is not universally true. Using <package>perf</package>, it was found that some
        workloads are memory-bound and do not benefit from a high degree of parallelization. In
        addition, for the final configuration, some workloads were parallelized to have one task per
        L3 cache in the system to maximize cache usage. The exception was the <emphasis
          role="italic">Scalar Pentadiagonal (SP)</emphasis> workload which was both memory bound
        and benefited from using all available CPUs. Also, note that the System Under Test used a
        pre-production CPU, that all memory channels were not populated and the memory speed was not
        the maximum speed supported by the platform. Hence, the optimal choices for this test may
        not be universally true for all AMD EPYC platforms. This highlights that there is no
        universal good choice for optimizing a workload for a platform and that experimentation and
        validation of tuning parameters is vital.</para>

      <para>The basic compilation flags simply turned on all safe optimizations. The tuned flags
        used <parameter>-Ofast</parameter> which can be unsafe for some mathematical workloads but
        generated the correct output for NPB. The other flags used the optimal instructions
        available on the distribution compiler and vectorized some operations. <package>GCC
          10</package> is more strict in terms of matching types in Fortran. Depending on the
        version of NPB used, it may be necessary to specify the
          <parameter>-fallow-argument-mismatch</parameter> or
          <parameter>-fallow-invalid-boz</parameter> to compile unless the source code is
        modified.</para>

      <para>As NPB uses shared files, an XFS partition was used for the temporary files. It is,
        however, only used for mapping shared files and is not a critical path for the benchmark and
        no IO tuning is necessary. In some cases with MPI applications, it will be possible to use a
          <filename>tmpfs</filename> partition for OpenMPI. This avoids unnecessary IO assuming the
        increased physical memory usage does not cause the application to be paged out.</para>

    <title>Using AMD EPYC 7003 Series processors for virtualization</title>

    <para> Running Virtual Machines (VMs) has some aspects in common with running
        <quote>regular</quote> tasks on a host operating system. Therefore, most of the tuning
      advice described so far in this document are valid and applicable to this section too. </para>

    <para> However, virtualization workloads do pose their own specific challenges and some special
      considerations need to be made, to achieve a better tailored and more effective set of tuning
      advice, for cases where a server is used only as a virtualization host. And this is especially
      relevant for large systems, such as AMD EPYC 7003 Series processors. </para>

    <para>This is because:</para>

    <itemizedlist>
      <listitem>
        <para>VMs typically run longer, and consume more memory, than most of others
            <quote>regular</quote> OS processes.</para>
      </listitem>
      <listitem>
        <para>VMs can be configured to behave either as NUMA-aware or non NUMA-aware
            <quote>workloads</quote>.</para>
      </listitem>
    </itemizedlist>

    <para> In fact, VMs often run for hours, days, or even months, without being terminated or
      restarted. Therefore, it is almost never acceptable to pay the price of suboptimal resource
      partitioning and allocation, even when there is the expectation that things will be better
      next time. For example, it is always desirable that vCPUs run close to the memory that they
      are accessing. For reasonably big NUMA aware VMs, this happens only with proper mapping of the
      virtual NUMA nodes of the guest to physical NUMA nodes on the host. For smaller, NUMA-unaware
      VMs, that means allocating all their memory on the smallest possible number of host NUMA
      nodes, and making their vCPUs run on the pCPUs of those nodes as much as possible. </para>

    <para> Also, poor mapping of virtual machine resources (virtual CPUs and memory, but also IO) on
      the host topology induces performance degradation to everything that runs inside the virtual
      machine – and potentially even to other components of the system . </para>

    <para> Regarding NUMA-awareness, a VM is called out to be NUMA aware if a (virtual) NUMA
      topology is defined and exposed to the VM itself and if the OS that the VM runs (guest OS) is
      also NUMA aware. On the contrary, a VM is called NUMA-unaware if either no (virtual) NUMA
      topology is exposed or the guest OS is not NUMA aware. </para>

    <para> VMs that are large enough (in terms of amount of memory and number of virtual CPUs) to
      span multiple host NUMA nodes, benefit from being configured as NUMA aware VMs. However, even
      for small and NUMA-unaware VMs, wise placement of their memory on the host nodes, and
      effective mapping of their virtual CPUs (vCPUs) on the host physical CPUs (pCPUs) is key for
      achieving good and consistent performance. </para>

    <para> This second half of the present document focuses on tuning a system where CPU and memory
      intensive workloads run inside VMs. We will explain how to configure and tune both the host
      and the VMs, in a way that performance comparable to the ones of the host can be achieved. </para>

    <para> Both the Kernel-based Virtual Machine (KVM) and the Xen-Project hypervisor (Xen), as
      available in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2, provide mechanisms to enact this kind of
      resource partitioning and allocation. </para>

    <note>
      <title>Virtual Machine types</title>

      <para> KVM only supports one type of VM – a fully hardware-based virtual machine (HVM). Under
        Xen, VMs can be paravirtualized (PV) or hardware virtualized machines (HVM). </para>

      <para> Xen HVM guests with paravirtualized interfaces enabled (called PVHVM, or HVM) are very
        similar to KVM VMs, which are based on hardware virtualization but also employ
        paravirtualized IO (VirtIO). In this document, we always refer to Xen VMs of the (PV)HVM
        type. </para>

      <title>Allocating resources to the host OS</title>

      <para> Even if the main purpose of a server is <quote>limited</quote> to running VMs, some
        activities will be carried out on the host OS. In fact, in both Xen and KVM, the host OS is
        at least responsible for helping with the IO of the VMs. It may, therefore, be necessary to
        make sure that the host OS has some resources (namely, CPUs and memory) exclusively assigned
        to itself. </para>

      <note>
        <title>Host OS on KVM and on Xen</title>
        <para> On KVM, the host OS is the SUSE Linux Enterprise distribution installed on the
          server, which then loads the hypervisor kernel modules. On Xen, the host OS still is a
          SUSE Linux Enterprise distribution, but it runs inside what is to all the effect an
          (although special) Virtual Machine (called Domain 0, or Dom0). </para>
      </note>

      <para> In the absence of any specific requirements involving host resources, a good rule of
        thumb suggests that 5 to 10 percent of the physical RAM should be reserved to the host OS.
        On KVM, increase that quota in case the plan is to run many (for example hundreds) of VMs.
        On Xen, it is okay to always give dom0 not more than a few GigaBytes of memory. This is
        especially the case when planning to take advantage of disaggregation (see <link
          xlink:href="https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Dom0_Disaggregation">
          https://wiki.xenproject.org/wiki/Dom0_Disaggregation</link>). </para>

      <para> In terms of CPUs, depending on the workload, it may be fine to use all the physical
        CPUs for the VMs (and this is in fact how the benchmarks in the experimental section of this
        guide have been conducted). On the other hand, if it is necessary to keep some CPUs for the
        host Os / dom0, we advise to reserve at least one physical core on each NUMA node. If that
        is not possible, consider reserving at least one core on the NUMA node(s) that have IO
        channels attached to it (them). In fact, host OS activities are mostly related to performing
        IO for VMs. It is beneficial for performance if the kernel threads that handle devices can
        run on the node to which the devices themselves are attached. As an example, in the system
        shown in <xref linkend="fig-epyc-topology"/>, this would mean reserving at least one
        physical core for the host OS on node 0. </para>

      <para> System administrators need to be able to reach out and login to the system, to monitor,
        manage and troubleshoot it. Therefore, it is possible that even more resources needs to be
        assigned to the host OS. This would be for making sure that management tools (for example,
        the <emphasis role="strong">SSH</emphasis> daemon) can be reached, and that the hypervisor's
        toolstack (for example, <package>libvirt</package>) can run without too much contention. </para>

        <para> When using Xen, dom0 resource allocation needs to be done explicitly at system boot
          time. For example, assigning 8 physical cores and 12 GB of RAM to it is done by specifying
          the following additional parameters on the hypervisor boot command line (for example, by
          editing <filename>/etc/defaults/grub</filename>, and then updating the boot loader): </para>

        <para> The number of vCPUs is 16 because we want Dom0 to have 8 physical cores, and the AMD
          EPYC 7003 Series Processor has Symmetric MultiThreading (SMT). 12288M memory (that is 12
          GB) is specified both as current and as maximum value, to prevent Dom0 from using
          ballooning (see <link

        <para> Making sure that Dom0 vCPUs run on specific pCPUs is not strictly necessary. If
          wanted, it can be enforced acting on the Xen scheduler, when Dom0 is booted (as there is
          currently no mechanism to set up this via Xen boot time parameters). If using the
            <package>xl</package> toolstack, the command is:</para>

          will affect both memory and vCPUs. In fact, it means that memory for Dom0 will be
          allocated on the specified node(s), and the vCPUs of Dom0 will be restricted to run on
          those same node(s). When the Dom0 has booted, it is still possible to use <command>xl

    <sect2 xml:id="sec-trasparent-huge-pages">
      <title>(Transparent) Huge Pages</title>

      <para> For virtualization workloads, rather than using Transparent Huge Pages (THP) on the
        host, it is recommended that 1 GB huge pages are used for the memory of the VMs. This
        sensibly reduces both the page table management overhead and the level of resource
        contention that the system faces when VMs update their page tables. Moreover, if the host is
        entirely devoted to running VMs, Huge Pages are likely not required for host OS processes.
        Actually, in this case, having them active on the host may even negatively affect
        performance, as the THP service daemon (which is there for merging <quote>regular</quote>
        pages and form Huge Pages) can interfere with VMs' vCPUs execution. For disabling Huge Pages
        for the host OS, in a KVM setup, add the following host kernel command-line option: </para>

      <screen>transparent_hugepage=never</screen>

      <para>Or execute this command, at runtime:</para>

      <screen>echo never > /sys/kernel/mm/transparent_hugepage/enabled</screen>

      <para> To use 1 GB Huge Pages as backing memory of KVM guests, such pages need to be allocated
        at the host OS level. It is best to make that happen by adding the following boot time
        parameter: </para>

      <screen>default_hugepagesz=1GB hugepagesz=1GB hugepages=&lt;number of hugepages></screen>

      <para> The value <parameter>&lt;number of hugepages></parameter> can be computed by taking
        the amount of memory we want to devoted to VMs, and dividing it by the page size (1 GB). For
        example on our host with 256 GB of RAM, creating 200 Huge Pages means we can accommodate up
        to 210 GB of VMs' RAM, and leave plenty (~50GB) to the host OS. </para>

      <para> On Xen, none of the above is necessary. In fact, Dom0 is a paravirtualized guest, for
        which Huge Pages support is not present. On the other hand, for the memory used for the
        hypervisor and for the memory allocated by the hypervisor for HVM VMs, Huge Pages are always
        used as much as possible. So no explicit tuning is needed. </para>

      <para> On Xen, Automatic NUMA Balancing (NUMAB) in the host OS should be disabled. Dom0 is,
        currently, a paravirtualized guest without a (virtual) NUMA topology and, thus, NUMAB would
        be totally useless. </para>

      <para> On KVM, NUMAB can be useful in dynamic virtualization scenarios, where VMs are created,
        destroyed and re-created relatively quickly. Or, in general, it can be useful in cases where
        it is not possible or desirable to statically partition the host resources and assign them
        explicitly to VMs. This, however, comes at the price of some latency being introduced. Plus,
        NUMAB's own operation can interfere with VMs' execution and cause further performance
        degradation. In any case, this document focuses on achieving the best possible performance
        for VMs, through specific tuning and static resource allocation, therefore it is recommended
        to leave NUMAB turned off. This can be done by adding the following parameter to the host
        kernel command line: </para>

      <para> Secure Encrypted Virtualization (SEV) technology, supported on the 3rd Generation AMD

        in the VM's own configuration file, but there are preparation steps that needs to occur at
        the host level. </para>

      <para> The <package>libvirt</package> documentation contains all the necessary steps required
        for enabling SEV on a host that supports it. It has been enough to add the following boot

      <para> It should be noted that, at least as far as the workload analyzed in this document,

        view of not hurting performance of VMs and workloads that will not enable VM memory
        encryption. Of course, this applies to when SEV is enabled for the host and is

    <para> For example, if there are two VMs, each one should be run on one socket, to minimize CPU

      enough, they should be made aware of their own virtual topology. That way, all the tuning
      actions described in the first part of this document become applicable to the workloads
      running inside the VMs too. </para>

    <sect2 xml:id="sec-placement-vms">
      <title>Placement of VMs</title>

      <para> When a VM is created, memory is allocated on the host to act as its virtual RAM. Moving
        this memory, for example on a different NUMA node from the one where it is first allocated,
        incurs (when possible) in a significant performance impact. Therefore, it is of paramount
        importance that the initial placement of the VMs is as optimal as possible. Both Xen and KVM
        can make <quote>educated guesses</quote> on what a good placement might be. For the purpose
        of this document, however, we are interested in what is the absolute best possible initial
        placement of the VMs, taking into account the specific characteristics of AMD EPYC 7003
        Series processor systems. And this can only be achieved by <emphasis role="strong"
          >manually</emphasis> doing the initial placement. Of course, this comes at the price of
        reduced flexibility, and is only possible when there is no oversubscription. </para>

      <para> Deciding on what pCPUs the vCPUs of a VM run, can be done at creation time, but also
        easily changed along the VM lifecycle. It is, however, still recommended to start the VMs
        with good vCPUs placement. This is particularly important on Xen, where vCPU placement is
        what actually drives and controls memory placement. </para>

      <para>Placement of VM memory on host NUMA nodes happens by means of the &lt;numatune> XML
        element:</para>

      <screen>
&lt;numatune>
  &lt;memory mode='strict' nodeset='0-1'/>
  &lt;memnode cellid='0' mode='strict' nodeset='0'/>
  &lt;memnode cellid='1' mode='strict' nodeset='1'/>
  ...
&lt;/numatune>  
      </screen>

      <para> The <parameter>'strict'</parameter> guarantees that the all memory for the VM will come
        only from the specified (set of) NUMA node(s) specified in <parameter>nodeset</parameter>. A
        cell is, in fact, a virtual NUMA node, with <parameter>cellid</parameter> being its ID and
          <parameter>nodeset</parameter> telling exactly from what host physical NUMA node(s) the
        memory for this virtual node should be allocated. A NUMA-unaware VMs can still include this
        element in its configuration file. It will have only one
          <parameter>&lt;memnode></parameter> element. </para>

      <para>Placement of vCPUs happens via the <parameter>&lt;cputune></parameter> element, as
        in the example below:</para>

      <screen>
&lt;vcpu placement='static'>240&lt;/vcpu>
&lt;cputune>
  &lt;vcpupin vcpu='0' cpuset='4'/>
  &lt;vcpupin vcpu='1' cpuset='132'/>
  &lt;vcpupin vcpu='2' cpuset='5'/>
  &lt;vcpupin vcpu='3' cpuset='133'/>
  ...
&lt;/cputune>
      </screen>

      <para> The value <parameter>240</parameter> means that the VM will have 240 vCPUs. The
          <parameter>static</parameter> guarantees that each vCPU will stay on the pCPU(s) on which
        it is <quote>pinned</quote> to. The various <parameter>&lt;vcpupin></parameter> elements
        are where the mapping between vCPUs and pCPUs is established (<parameter>vcpu</parameter>
        being the vCPU ID and <parameter>cpuset</parameter> being either one or a list of pCPU IDs). </para>

      <para> To use all of the available 256 pCPUs for a VM, specify <parameter>256</parameter>. In
        addition to that, though, the following element should be added in the
          <parameter>&lt;device></parameter> section:</para>

      <screen>
&lt;devices>
  ...
  &lt;iommu model='intel'>
    &lt;driver intremap='on'/>
  &lt;/iommu>
  ...
&lt;/devices>        
    </screen>

      <para> When pinning vCPUs to pCPUs, adjacent vCPU IDs (like vCPU ID 0 and vCPU ID 1) must be
        assigned to host SMT siblings (like pCPU 65 and pCPU 193, on our test server). In fact, QEMU
        uses a static SMT sibling CPU ID assignment. This is how we guarantee that virtual SMT
        siblings will always execute on actual physical SMT siblings. </para>

      <para> The following sections give more specific and precise details about placement of vCPUs
        and memory for VM of varying sizes of VMs, on the reference system for this guide (see <xref

        <para> The VM Memory must be split equally among the 2 nodes. At this point, if a suitable

          as it happens on the host. Workloads running inside the VM can be tuned exactly like they

          5 to Core L#6, etc. To enact this, we must pin vCPUs 0 and 1 to pCPUs 4 and 132; vCPUs 2

          interference between the host and the VM. If that damages the performance of the workloads

          each core is to use one of the two threads for the actual vCPU, and the other for its IO
          thread(s), on the host. This solution allows to take advantage of the full 3rd Generation
          AMD EPYC processing power. However, we advise to check and verify whether this is a good

      <title>Emulator IO threads &amp; disaggregation</title>

      <para> IO for the VMs is carried out by device emulators running on the host, or by the
        so-called <emphasis role="italic">back-ends</emphasis> of paravirtualized drivers (also
        running on the host). Both the IO threads of the emulators and the back-ends are seen as
        (either user or kernel) threads by the host OS. As such, they can be configured to run on
        specific subsets of the CPUs assigned to the host OS (Dom0’s virtual CPUs, in the case of
        Xen). And their placement on such CPUs may have an impact on performance of VMs, especially
        on IO bound workloads. </para>

      <para> For example, a 1 vCPU VM can have its vCPU bound to the one SMT thread of a core, while
        the other thread can be assigned to the host, and the IO thread(s) of the VM pinned to it.
        The idea behind this is that a common execution pattern for the vCPU is to be idle when the

        resources. </para>

      <para> On Xen, there is also the possibility of setting up driver domains. These are special

      <title>Oversubscription of host resources</title>

      <para> Oversubscription happens when the demand for some resource is higher than the resource
        is physically available. In virtualization, this can happen for CPU and memory. </para>

      <note>
        <title>Not covering oversubscribed scenarios</title>
        <para> This guide does not cover in great details oversubscribed scenarios. However, given
          the large number of CPUs available on an AMD EPYC 7003 Series processor system and the
          huge amount of memory the architecture supports, this is not considered a limitation.
        </para>
      </note>

      <bridgehead>CPU Oversubscription</bridgehead>

      <para> CPU oversubscription happens when the total cumulative number of vCPUs from all VMs
        becomes higher than 256. Such situation unavoidably introduces latencies, and leads to lower
        performance than when host resources are just enough. It is, however, impossible to tell a
        priori by what extent this happens, at least not without a detailed knowledge of the actual
        workload. </para>

      <para> If we knew in advance that the load on each vCPU will always stay below 50%, we could
        assume that even oversubscribing the host by a factor of 2 (like with ~512 vCPUs, in our
        case!) will work well. On the other hand, if we knew that the load that each vCPU tries to
        impose on the system is always 100%, creating even 1 vCPUs more than the host has pCPUs
        would already lead to a misconfiguration. </para>

      <para> When under oversubscription, exclusive 1-to-1 vCPU to pCPU assignment may not the best
        approach. However, we need to trust the hypervisor scheduler to handle the situation well
        (which is very likely what will happen). What can be done, though, is to provide the
        hypervisor scheduler with some <quote>suggestions</quote>, if we have enough knowledge about
        the workload. For example, we can try to help the scheduler avoiding that all the VMs
        running CPU intensive workloads end on the same nodes, or avoiding cross-node VM migrations
        happening too frequently. </para>

      <para> This grouping of VMs on (a set of) nodes can be done with some less strict forms of
        vCPU pinning (often called <quote>affinity</quote>), or with other mechanisms. For example,
          <package>cgroups</package> can be leveraged on a KVM host, or <package>cpupools</package>
        on a Xen host. Xen also contains a feature, called <emphasis role="italic">soft vCPU
          affinity</emphasis>, which can be used together with <quote>traditional</quote> vCPU
        affinity (also called <emphasis role="italic">hard vCPU affinity</emphasis>) as a finer
        grained and more powerful way of controlling resource allocation in oversubscribed scenario. </para>

      <bridgehead>Memory Oversubscription</bridgehead>

      <para> Memory oversubscription happens when the total cumulative amount of memory used by all
        VMs is more than the RAM available on the host. In this case, some of such memory is kept
        outside of the RAM (<emphasis role="italic">swapped out</emphasis>) when the VMs using it
        are not running. It is put back in RAM (<emphasis role="italic">swapped in</emphasis>) when
        these VMs run again. This also has (potentially severe) performance implications, and is not
        analyzed in details in here. </para>

      <para> On KVM, swapping is handled by Linux virtual memory management and paging code and
        mechanism, exactly as it happens for host/bare metal processes. On Xen, this is not
        supported unless special technologies (<package>xenpaging</package> or transcendent memory)
        are employed. </para>

      <para>Then there are page sharing and memory ballooning.</para>
      <para>Page sharing relies on the principle that, when VMs use memory pages which are
        identical, only one copy of them needs to be kept in physical RAM, at least for most of the
        time. This is supported on KVM, via a mechanism called Kernel Samepage Merging (KSM). On
        Xen, this again require special tools and actions.</para>

      <para>Ballooning relies on the idea that VMs do not always use all the memory they are
        configured to be able to use. This is supported in both Xen and KVM. However, using it is
        not ideal for performance, thus it is not analyzed in any further details in this document. </para>

&lt;/cpu>
        </screen>

        <para> The <parameter>&lt;topology></parameter> element specifies the CPU
          characteristics. In this case, we are creating vCPUs which will be seen by the guest OS as
          being arranged in 2 sockets, each of which has 64 cores, each of which has 2 threads. And
          this is how we match, for the one big VM, the topology of the host. </para>

        <para> Each <parameter>&lt;cell></parameter> element defines one virtual NUMA node,
          specifying how much memory and which vCPUs are part of it. The
            <parameter>&lt;distances></parameter> elements allow us to define a custom virtual
          NUMA distance table. Values should be - as it is on actual hardware - an indication of the
          latency of accessing the memory of every node from any other. And again we are defining a
          virtual distance table which exactly matches the host one, for the one big VM. </para>

        <para> CPU model is how the VM is told what type of vCPUs should be <quote>emulated</quote>,

          wrong results. In fact, such setting prevents the topology - despite it being described
          correctly in the <parameter>&lt;topology></parameter> element - from being interpreted
          correctly, inside the VM. This is visible in the output of the command

        <para> Benchmarks have shown that misunderstanding the CPUs as being all individual cores,
          without there being SMT, has a negative impact on performance. Note that the problem not
          only involves CPU topology, it is also the cache hierarchy structure which is not
          constructed consistently with the host. In fact, while the sizes of L1d and L1i caches is
          wrong (it is 64k instead than 32k, see <xref linkend="fig-epyc-topology"/>). It is also
          the information about which CPUs share what caches that is completely misconfigured, as

        <para> The VM thinks that L1d, L1i and L2 are private of each vCPU. That is not the case, as
          they are shared by the two threads of each core. Even worse, it thinks that L3 is shared
          across all the vCPUs of a socket, which is not true, as it is shared only among 8 cores
          (that is 16 vCPUs). </para>

        <para> For this reason, the recommendation is to use <parameter>EPYC</parameter> as the CPU
          model (as a 3rd Generation AMD EPYC processor model is not yet available). This enables a
          virtual topology inside the VM what is more consistent (although not perfectly identical)
          with the one of the host, and benchmark shows a beneficial effect on performance coming
          from that. The output of <command>lscpu</command> with <parameter>EPYC</parameter> as a

        <para> Now it is the cache sizes that are slightly off, with regard to the host value. And
          this is because they are the values taken from previous generation AMD EPYC processors
          architecture characteristics. But the cache topology and cache level sharing among vCPUs
          are now closer to the host ones (not perfectly, as <parameter>index3</parameter> should
          report <parameter>0-15</parameter>). This is far more important for achieving performance
          inside the VM that matches the one of the host. This is shown here: </para>

        <para>Related to this, on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP2 it would be possible to use

      <para>This seems counter-intuitive, as using host-passthrough and enabling the

    <title>Conclusion</title>

    <para>The introduction of AMD EPYC 7003 Series processors pushes the boundaries of what is
      possible for memory and IO-bound workloads with much higher bandwidth and available number of
      channels. A properly configured and tuned workload can exceed the performance of many
      contemporary off-the-shelf solutions even when fully customized. The symmetric and balanced
      nature of the machine makes the task of tuning a workload considerably easier given that each
      partition can have symmetric performance. And this is a property that can turn out
      particularly handy in virtualization, as each virtual machine can be assigned to each one of
      the partitions.</para>

    <para>With SUSE Linux Enterprise, all the tools to monitor and tune a workload are readily
      available. Your customers can extract the maximum performance and reliability running their
      applications on the 3rd Generation AMD EPYC processor platform.</para>
