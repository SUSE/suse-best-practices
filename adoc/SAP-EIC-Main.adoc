= {eic} on SUSE

== Introduction

This guide describes how to prepare your infrastructure for the installation of {eic} on {rke} using {rancher}.
It will guide you through the steps of:

* Installing {rancher}
* Setup {rke} clusters
* Deploy mandatory components for {eic}
// * Deploying {eic} into your {rke}

NOTE: This guide does not contain information about sizing your landscapes. Please refer to 
https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite?locale=en-US and look for the "Edge Integration Cell Sizing Guide".

== Preparations

* Get subscriptions for:
** {slem} {slem_version}
** {rancher}
** {lh}

* Check the storage requirements.

* Create a or get access to a private container registry.

* Get an SAP S-user to access software and documentation by SAP.

* Read the relevant SAP documentation:

** https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839[Release Note for SAP Edge Integration Cell]

** https://me.sap.com/notes/2946788[Release Note for SAP ELM Bridge]

== Installing {slem} {slem_version}
There are several ways to install {slem} {slem_version}. We will use in our Best Practice Guide the installation method via the graphical installer. Further installation routines can be found in the https://documentation.suse.com/sle-micro/5.4/html/SLE-Micro-all/book-deployment-slemicro.html[Deployment Guide].

== Installing {metallb} and databases

In this chapter we'll give an example how to setup {metallb}, {redis} and {pg}.

NOTE: Please note, that this might differ from the deployment you'll need for your infrastructure and use-cases.

=== Login to {rac}

{rancher} instances prior to version 2.9 can not integrate the {rac}. Thus you need to use the console and Helm.
The easiest way to do so is to use the built-in shell in {rancher}. To access it, navigate to your cluster and click on *Kubectl Shell* as shown below:

image::EIC-Rancher-Kubectl-Button.png[title=Rancher Shell Access,scaledwidth=99%]

A shell will open as in the given picture:

image::EIC-Rancher-Kubectl-Shell.png[title=Rancher Shell Overview,scaledwidth=99%]


You will need to login to the {rac} which can be done like:
----
$ helm registry login dp.apps.rancher.io/charts -u <yourUser> -p <your-token>
----


[#imagePullSecret]
=== Creating an imagePullSecret
To make the ressources be available to roll out, you'll need to create a imagePullSecret.
In this guide we'll use the name application-collection for it.

==== Creating a imagePullSecret using kubectl

Using kubectl to create the imagePullSecret is quite easy.
Get your username and your access token for the {rac}.
Then run:
----
$ kubectl create secret docker-registry application-collection --docker-server=dp.apps.rancher.io --docker-username=<yourUser> --docker-password=<yourPassword>
----

==== Creating an imagePullSecret using {rancher}

You can also create an imagePullSecret using {rancher}.
Therefore open {rancher} and enter your cluster.

Navigate to *Storage* -> *Secrets* as shown below:

image::EIC-Secrets-Menu.png[title=Secrets Menu,scaledwidth=99%]

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

Select the *Create* button in the upper right corner.

image::EIC-Secrets-Overview.png[title=Secrets Overview,scaledwidth=99%]

A selection screen will be shown asking you to choose the Secret type. Select *Registry* as shown here:

image::EIC-Secrets-Types.png[title=Secrets Type Selection,scaledwidth=99%]

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

Enter a name like application-collection for the Secret. For the text field *Registry Domain Name*, enter dp.apps.rancher.io .
Enter your username and password and hit the *Create* button on the bottom right side.

=== Installing {metallb}

This chapter is to guide you through the installation and configuration of {metallb} on your Kubernetes cluster used for the {eic}.

<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

=== Installing {redis}

// https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/prepare-your-kubernetes-cluster#redis-data-store-requirements

Before deploying {redis}, make sure that the requirements described in
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839
are met.

Furthermore make sure to get an understanding of what grade of persistence you want to achieve for your {redis} cluster.
To get more information about persistence in {redis}, have a look at
https://redis.io/docs/management/persistence/ .

=== Installing {pg}

// https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/prepare-your-kubernetes-cluster#postgresql-database-requirements

Before deploying {pg}, make sure that the requirements described in
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839 are met.

include::SAP-EIC-PostgreSQL.adoc[]

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

== Installing {eic}

// include::SAP-EIC.adoc[]
At this point, you should be able to deploy {eic}.
Please follow the instructions at https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/setting-up-and-managing-edge-integration-cell
to install {eic} in your prepared environments.

=== Using self signed certificates

In this chapter we will explain how to create self signed certificates and how to make them available within Kubernetes.

==== Create the self signed certificates

CAUTION: It is discouraged to use self signed certifcates for production environments.

As a first step, you need to create a certificate authority (further called CA) with its key and certificate.
In the excerpt below you can find an example how create such with a passpharse of your choice:
----
$ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 1825 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout rootCA.key -out rootCA.crt -passout pass:<ca-passphrase> -subj "/C=DE/ST=BW/L=Nuremberg/O=SUSE"
----

This gives you the *rootCA.key* and the *rootCA.crt*.
For the server certificate, a certificate signing request (further called CSR) is needed.
The given excerpt show how to create such a CSR:
----
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout domain.key -out domain.csr -passout pass:<csr-passphrase> -subj  "/C=DE/ST=BW/L=Nuremberg/O=SUSE"
----

Before you can sing the CSR, you'll need to add the DNS names of your Kuberntes Services to the CSR.
Therefore create a file with the content below and replace the *<servicename>* and *<namespace>* with the name of your Kubernetes service and the namespace this is placed in:
 
----
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = <servicename>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
DNS.2 = <AltService>.<AltNamespace>.svc.cluster.local
----

You can now use the previously created rootCA.key and rootCA.crt with the extension file to sign the CSR.
The example below shows how to do that by passing the extension file (here named *domain.ext*):
----
$ openssl x509 -req -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -in domain.csr -out server.pem -days 365 -CAcreateserial -extfile domain.ext -passin pass:<ca-passphrase>
----

This creates a file called *server.pem* which is your certificate to be used for your application.


Your *domain.key* is at this point still encrypted, but the application will need an uncrypted server key.
To decrypt, run the given command, which will create the *server.key*
----
$ openssl rsa -passin pass:<csr-passphrase> -in domain.key -out server.key
----

Some applications (like Redis) require a full certificate chain to operate.
To get a full certificate chain, concat the generated *server.pem* with the *rooCA.crt* like below:

----
$ cat server.pem rootCA.crt > chained.pem
----

Afterwards you should have the files called server.pem, server.key and chained.pem which can be used for your applications like Redis or PostgresSQL.


==== Upload certificates to Kubernetes

To use certificate files in Kubernetes, you need to store them as so called *secrets*.
An example how to upload your certificates to Kubernetes is shown in the given excerpt:
 
----
$ kubectl -n <namespace> create secret generic <certName> --from-file=./root.pem --from-file=./server.pem --from-file=./server.key
----

NOTE: Most applications are expecting to have the secret to be used in the same namespace as the application.
