Introduction
------------
IT security is an essential topic for any organization. Newspapers report frequently about new IT security incidents such as hacked websites, successful Denial-of-Service attacks, or stolen user data like passwords, bank account numbers and other sensitive data.

In addition to the publicly reported attacks, there are also a large number of incidents that are not reported to the public. In particular, these cases are often related to espionage, where the affected party has no interest to report an incident.
Security experts agree that, for protecting sensitive data, an organization must have a comprehensive security concept in place, taking all eventualities into account that can potentially lead into security risks. This starts with proper setup policies, 
like password and data protection policies for users and system administrators. It continues with a protected IT environment using for example firewalls, VPNs, and SSL in communication protocols. And it ends with hardened servers, intrusion detection systems, 
data encrypting and automated security reporting. 
Additionally, many organizations perform security audits on a regular basis to ensure a maximum of security in their IT environment.

Comprehensive security concepts usually pay high attention to database systems, since databases belong to the most critical components in any IT environment. Database systems that potentially store sensitive data are by nature very popular targets for hackers and must therefore be protected.
SAP HANA systems typically store business related information and are considered as being business critical. This is especially the case for ERP systems using SAP HANA. In addition, many other SAP applications using SAP HANA, like BW systems, may store sensitive data.

Security for SAP HANA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
SAP takes the security topic very seriously. For SAP HANA, there is a comprehensive https://help.sap.com/doc/eec734dbb0fd1014a61590fcb5411390/2.0.05/en-US/SAP_HANA_Security_Guide_en.pdf[SAP HANA Security Guide] available. This guide describes in detail how to protect HANA from a database perspective.
The guide also refers to security concepts for other connecting layers that are separate from the SAP HANA system, for example the network and storage layer. However, these topics are described only generically. There is no specific guidance on how to apply these recommendations on the operating system level.

Security for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The security of the underlying operating system is at least as important as the security of the SAP HANA database. Many hacker attacks target the operating system to gain access and sufficient privileges to attack the running database application.
SUSE Linux Enterprise Server is the recommended and supported operating system for SAP HANA. SUSE has a long-running history in IT security for Linux operating systems. The company offers a comprehensive security package for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server to protect systems from all kind of security incidents. 
This package consists of the following components:

// Certifications of SLES 15 is planned for 2019. Therefore this block is commented out and replaced with a note until we have them.
//Security certifications:: SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 achieved many important security certifications, like the FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) 140-2 validation or the Common Criteria Security certification EAL4+.
//For details please visit: https://www.suse.com/support/security/certifications/.

Security certifications:: Both SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 and SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 have been awarded many important security certifications, such as the FIPS (Federal Information Processing Standard) 140-2 validation, or the Common Criteria EAL4+ certificate.
For details visit https://www.suse.com/support/security/certifications/.


Security updates and patches:: SUSE constantly provides security updates and patches for their SUSE Linux Enterprise operating systems and guarantees highest security standards during the entire product life cycle.

Documentation:: SUSE has published a Hardening Guide and a Security Guide that describe the security concepts and features of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15. 
These guides provide generic security and hardening information valid for all workloads, not just for SAP HANA. For more details visit:

About this document
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To further improve the security level specifically for SAP HANA, SUSE provides the document at hand. It focuses on the security hardening of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 running SAP HANA databases to fill the gap between the Security Guide for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, the Hardening Guide for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, and the SAP HANA Security Guide. 
The Hardening Guide for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server contains some of the recommendations found here, but also additional recommendations. Most of the recommendations can be applied to an SAP HANA installation after careful review and testing. SUSE collaborated with a large pilot customer to identify all relevant security settings and to avoid problems in real world scenarios. 
Also, SUSE and SAP are constantly cooperating in the SAP Linux Lab to provide the best compatibility with SAP HANA.

.The five main topics of the OS Security Hardening for HANA
image::hardening_topics.svg[alt="The five main topics of the OS Security Hardening for HANA", scaledwidth="100%"]

The guide at hand provides detailed descriptions on the following topics:

Security hardening settings for SAP HANA systems:: 
The Linux operating system provides many tweaks and settings to further improve the operating system security and the security for the hosted applications. 
To be able to fit for certain application workloads, the default settings are not tuned for maximum security. 
This guide describes how to tune the operating system for maximum security when running SAP HANA specifically. 
In addition, it describes possible impacts, for example on system administration, and gives a prioritization of each setting.

Local firewall for SAP HANA:: 
SUSE has developed a dedicated local firewall for SAP HANA systems to improve the network security of SAP HANA. 
This is done by only selectively opening network ports on external network interfaces that are really needed either by SAP HANA or other services. 
All remaining network ports are closed. The firewall has a broad range of features and is easy to configure. It is available as RPM package and can be downloaded from SUSE.

Remote Disk Encryption:: Starting with SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications 12 SP2, SUSE introduced a new feature called *Remote Disk Encryption*. Classical Disk Encryption - available for years – always required a passphrase being entered during boot. That prevented its use in many setups because each boot needed a manual step.
Remote Disk Encryption removes this manual step as it allows the encryption keys to be stored safely on a remote key server and to be automatically used during system boot.

Minimal package selection:: The fewer operating system packages an SAP HANA system has installed, the less possible security holes it should have. Following that principle, this guide describes which packages are absolutely necessary and which packages can be safely discarded. As a positive side effect, a minimized number of packages also reduces the number of updates and patches that have to be applied to a system.

Security updates & patches:: 
Open source software is frequently reviewed and tested for security vulnerabilities by open source developers, 
security engineers from the open source community, security companies and, of course, by the hackers. 
When a vulnerability has been found and reported, it is published in security advisories and usually gets fixed very quickly. 
SUSE constantly provides security updates and patches for all supported packages on SUSE Linux Enterprise Server. 
This chapter explains which update and patch strategies are the best. 
It also details how to configure SUSE Linux Enterprise Server to frequently receive all relevant security updates.

In short, this guide covers all important topics in detail that are relevant for the operating system hardening of an SAP HANA system. Combining them with the other security features of SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15, like the security certifications and the constantly provided security updates and patches, SAP HANA can run in a highly secure environment. This ensures that the implementation meets the security standards and corporate security concepts required by organizations of all sizes.

.SAP HANA and Operating System Security

SAP HANA firewall
-----------------
SAP HANA network communication
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
NOTE: The SAP HANA firewall currently only includes rules for IPv4.

The section "Network Security" of the SAP HANA Security Guide (https://help.sap.com) recommends that different components of the SAP HANA database should operate in different network zones. 
Also, the network communication should be restrictively filtered to follow a minimal communication approach.

In practice, this results in segmenting the network communication of certain SAP HANA components into multiple dedicated IP networks (ISO/OSI Layer 3). 
The SAP HANA system is connected with exactly one interface to each IP network. Typically, these interfaces are logical bonding interfaces that include two or more physical interfaces for redundancy. 
The physical interfaces are connected to separated Ethernet network segments (ISO/OSI Layer 2).

.Example of a SAP HANA network diagram with external firewalls
image::hana_firewall_network_diagram.svg[alt="Example of a SAP HANA network diagram with external firewalls", scaledwidth="100%"]

All SAP HANA networks should be either isolated (this means distributed system networks), or if they require communication from other networks (this means user communication), they should be behind an external firewall. 
This external firewall should only allow traffic for a SAP HANA network that is required for the communication with the SAP HANA services that are listening on this network.

In some cases an external firewall cannot be provided, or certain networks are shared between many servers but not just SAP HANA database systems. 
In these case, a local running firewall can take over some of the functionalities of an external firewall.

Local firewall for SAP HANA
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The security of an SAP HANA database can be further improved by configuring a locally running firewall. 
This firewall should only allow network communication on ports where HANA services or other required system services are listening. 
Communication to all other ports should be dropped and optionally be logged. 
This complies with the “minimal communication approach” suggested in the SAP HANA Security Guide.

SUSE developed a dedicated local firewall for SAP HANA, based on Linux `iptables`. 
This firewall takes all requirements from typical SAP HANA systems into account.

The firewall provides the following features:
//CHECK THIS LIST!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!

* Predefined SAP HANA services definitions (according to the SAP HANA Master Guide)
* Protection of multiple SAP HANA instances running on one server
* Interface / service mappings for an unlimited number of interfaces
* Possibility to directly use service definitions from /etc/services
* Option to restrict access to services to certain source networks
* Simulating option that prints the `iptables` commands to the console instead of executing them (What if...)

.Example of a SAP HANA Firewall Network Diagram
image::hana_firewall_overview.svg[alt="Example of a SAP HANA Firewall Network Diagram", scaledwidth="100%"]

Not every scenario requires having a dedicated local firewall on the SAP HANA servers. 
For example, if all SAP HANA networks are behind a properly configured external firewall, a local firewall is not necessarily required.

However, in some cases it helps to improve the network security. It can even improve network debugging capabilities (→ logging of dropped packets). 
The most common cases for running a local firewall are:

* when an external firewall is not available to protect non-isolated SAP HANA networks from other networks (e.g. user network).
* when an external firewall can not be configured restrictively enough to only allow network communication for particular SAP HANA ports for certain SAP HANA networks.
* when an external firewall provides not enough security zones.
* when a protected network contains many different servers, such as non-SAP servers, in the same network.

There are several other reasons why a local firewall could make sense. For example, a local firewall prevents unwanted services or daemons listening TCP or UDP ports and receiving connections. 
That is because all not specifically allowed network ports are blocked by default. Also, unauthorized network traffic received on blocked ports can be logged. 
This allows to easily identify unwanted connection attempts. Last but not least, a local firewall can be a set requirement by corporate security policies or security audits.

Installation
~~~~~~~~~~~~
The SAP HANA firewall is available from the repositories for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications 15 and extends `firewalld` by adding rulesets.
----
zypper install HANA-Firewall
----

The package installs the following files:

|===
|`/usr/sbin/hana-firewall` | Firewall executable. A usage description can be printed with the command: `/usr/sbin/hana-firewall --help`
|`/etc/hana-firewall/` | Main configuration file
|`/etc/sysconfig/hana-firewall` | Directory for HANA services and user defined services
|`/usr/share/man/man8/hana-firewall.8.gz` | Man page for the HANA firewall
|===

Configuration
~~~~~~~~~~~~~
With SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15, `firewalld` replaces SUSE Firewall2, and HANA-Firewall is now an integral part. 
To get familiar with `firewalld`, refer to the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 Security Guide, 
section 18.4 "firewalld" at https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-15/singlehtml/book_security/book_security.html#sec.security.firewall.firewalld.

IMPORTANT: Before setting up the SAP HANA firewall, you first need to configure `firewalld` for all non-SAP related services like SSH.

To configure the SAP HANA firewall, follow the respective instructions detailed in the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications Guide, section https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-for-sap-15/singlehtml/book_s4s/book_s4s.html#sec.s4s.configure.firewall-hana[Configuring HANA-Firewall].

TIP: It is recommended to use the YaST HANA-Firewall module. There is no simple way to do this on the command line.

// Why is there no Quick Configuration Guide anymore?
//
// 1. In /etc/sysconfig/hana-firewall` you can only set the SAP HANA instance numbers in the parameter
// `HANA_INSTANCE_NUMBERS` as a space separated list. To enable services you have first to generate the
// firealld xml-files with "hana-firewall generate-firewalld-services" and  - this is the difficult
// part - correctly reference the short name in the XML zone definition (/etc/firewalld/zones/)!
//
// 2. The hana-firewall command is crap! The command "hana-firewall dry-run" shows all available
// service + ports regardless if they are enabled in a zone or not.

Services
~~~~~~~~
Service definitions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
A service is a named definition of TCP or UDP ports used by a specific network service. Common services are defined in `/etc/services`. 
For an easier configuration of the firewall, additional services are provided by the package, or can even be created manually.
The HANA Firewall service definitions are stored in the directory `/etc/hana-firewall/`. 
Each file defines one service and allows to define a list of ports or port ranges for TCP and UDP.

Predefined services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The SAP HANA Administrators Guide and the SAP HANA Security Guide describe all services and the required TCP/UDP ports that SAP HANA uses. 
These services can also be found in the tabular overview "TCP/IP Ports of All SAP Products" at https://help.sap.com/viewer/ports.
Most of these services are available as predefined services in the HANA-Firewall module:

[cols="2", options="header"]
.List of shipped SAP HANA service definitions (HANA-Firewall 1.1.5)
|===
^|Service Name
^a|Description
|`HANA cockpit`| More information may be found in the SAP knowledge base article 2389709.
|`HANA database client access`| Provide access to system database and all tenant databases.
|`HANA data provisioning`| Event streaming via SQLDBC (ODBC/JDBC) protocol.
|`HANA HTTP client access`| Allow web browser access to HANA.
|`HANA distributed systems`| Internal network communication for multi-host (distributed) installation.
|`HANA system replication`| Internal network communication for system replication for both single and multi container setup.
|`HANA studio lifecycle manager`| Allow connection to HANA lifecycle manager via host agent.
|`Software provisioning manager`| The port 4237 will allow web browsers to access software provisioning web UI remotely.
|`HANA special support`| The ports should be used in rare technical support scenarios. See HANA administration guide for more details.
|===

User-defined services
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
To create a new service, run:
----
hana-firewall define-new-hana-service
----
Follow the instructions on the screen.
After the service has been created, you have to generate the XML files:
----
hana-firewall generate-firewalld-services
----
Now the service should appear in the YaST HANA-Firewall module and can be assigned.

Testing and activation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
After the firewall has been configured, it should carefully be tested. After that, make sure that the firewall is started on system boot automatically:
----
systemctl enable firewalld.service
----
WARNING: Ensure there is no other non-SUSE firewall enabled that might start automatically.


SUSE Remote Disk Encryption
---------------------------
All data processed by SAP HANA can contain sensitive information that need to be protected. 
Depending on the version the data volume, redoing log files or database backups can be encrypted by the SAP HANA itself. 
For details consult the SAP HANA Security Guide at https://help.sap.com.

If the internal encryption of SAP HANA should not or cannot be used, you can encrypt directories containing sensitive data via Remote Disk Encrypting available in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications.
When using the internal encryption, the various encryption keys are stored on disk in the SSFS which is located by default in `<home-of-sidadm>/.hdb/<host-identity>/SSFS_HDB.DAT`.
The SSFS itself is encrypted with the SSFS master key, normally located in $DIR_GLOBAL/hdb/security/ssfs/, which is protected only by file permissions.
To protect this key or the SSFS Remote Disk Encrypting can help to reach higher security. It will not store any key of SAP HANA directly, but can encrypt the part of the file system where the keys are located.

SUSE Remote Disk Encryption uses block devices as an encrypted container for arbitrary directories. It allows to store the encryption keys safely on a remote key server. 
To mount the device, the host contacts the key server on a TLS secured connection to retrieve the necessary keys automatically to unlock the data.
Clearly the key server should be a dedicated, security-hardened, and protected system, since anyone with access to this system can retrieve the keys and decrypt the data.

The setup of client and server is described in more detail in the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for SAP applications guide, section 10 Encrypting Directories Using cryptctl at https://www.suse.com/documentation/sles-for-sap-15/.


Minimal operating system package selection
------------------------------------------

Background
~~~~~~~~~~
A typical Linux installation has many files that are potentially security-relevant. This is especially true for binary files and executables. 
Also, every running service might potentially be vulnerable to a local or remote attack. 
Therefore it is recommended to have as less files (binaries, executables, configuration files) as possible installed and as few services as possible running.

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server provides an RPM package for each logical component, like a Linux application, a service or a library. 
An RPM package groups all files, including executables, other binaries, configuration files and documentation files, that belong to this particular component. 
The most common packages are grouped by use cases as 'Installation Patterns'. 
These patterns can be selected during the operating system installation or later via YaST to easily get an installation that fits the requirements of a particular use case, for example for an SAP server with development tools.

Reducing the number of installed RPM packages to a minimum lowers the amount of potentially vulnerable files on the system. This significantly improves the overall security of a system. 
Furthermore, a low number of installed packages reduces the number of required (security) updates and patches that have to be applied to the system on a regular basis.
SAP HANA is a very complex application, shipped in different versions, and having many additional components, which makes it hard to choose the minimal list of packages.

Required installation patterns and packages
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The required software for SAP HANA is described in 'SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15.x for SAP applications Configuration Guide for SAP HANA' attached to SAP note '1944799 - SAP HANA Guidelines for SLES Operating System Installation' and lists the necessary patterns.

The recommendation is to install the system with the role "Minimal" (pattern "Base System"). Then add the patterns "Enhanced Base System" 
(which pulls in the patterns "AppArmor", "Software Management" and "YaST System Administration") and "SAP Application Server Base". 
The pattern "X Window System" should be installed only if needed. This results in a total amount of 746 packages, or 941 package if "X Window System" has been installed.

For SSL support, the `SAPCRYPTOLIB` (SAP package) and the SAR archiver tool should be installed in addition.

In some rare cases, the support might ask for the installation of additional packages. 
Therefore, we generally recommend to have SUSE Linux Enterprise Server update repositories configured on your HANA system to be able to quickly install new packages.

Security updates
----------------
Security updates for SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
No different from commercial software, open source software is tested by hackers and security experts for vulnerabilities. 
Also, it can contain programming errors. These facts may result in security risks. 
As soon as newly found security vulnerabilities are reported, for example on security mailing-lists or by security advisories, 
the affected code usually gets fixed quickly – sometimes even within hours. 
This is usually done either by the authors of the affected application, by security experts in the community, or by the Linux distributors.

For SUSE Linux Enterprise Server, the resulting security patches are quickly incorporated into the corresponding software package and published as security updates through our update channels. 
As soon as they are available there, they can be downloaded by all SUSE Linux Enterprise Server customers, and should be applied immediately.

SUSE Linux Enterprise Server update channels
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
To receive security updates (and other updated packages) on SAP HANA systems, the SUSE update channels must be configured properly. 
Usually SAP HANA systems do not have direct access to the Internet. This requires an update proxy between the corporate network and the Internet. 
Thus SUSE provides the Subscription Management Tool (SMT) or Repository Mirroring Tool (RMT), or SUSE Manager.

To verify that your HANA system has been configured properly to receive updates, check if it has been registered to the SUSE update channels:
----
zypper lr
----

This command lists the available software repositories of a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server instance. 
The output should show the update channels for all enabled modules of the particular Service Pack.

There are many ways to install new patches and also to selectively install just the security updates. 
The most common way to install only security updates is to execute the following commands:
----
zypper ref # Refreshes the update sources
zypper patch -g security # Install security patches only
----


Update and patch strategies
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
In many cases, organizations have corporate polices in place that describe requirements regarding updates and patches for their Linux servers.

The following overview describes some of the most common update and patch strategies, and their advantages and disadvantages.


Installing all new updates and patches on a regular basis
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description::
This strategy promotes the installation of new updates and patches for example once a day or once per week, either manually by a system administrator or using automatic update tools like YOU (YaST Online Update) or SUSE Manager. 
Since SUSE does not implement any new features between Service Packs, the installation of updates and patches (including security updates) is usually uncritical for a system. 
However, in some rare cases, updates might cause problems and can compromise the stability of a system.

Advantages:: 
The System is always up-to-date and latest security updates are applied quickly. This makes a system very secure.

Disadvantages:: 
In some rare cases, updates and patches might cause problems. Also, some updates (for example kernel updates) require a reboot.

Recommendation:: 
This is a good strategy for all non-productive HANA systems, but not for systems that are in production.


Installing all new updates and patches during maintenance windows
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description:: This strategy is very similar to the last one, but it ensures that a SAP HANA system is out of production or tagged with a limited availability during the update cycle. 
This is a very commonly used strategy for systems running large databases.

Advantages:: 
Problematic updates will not put a productive SAP HANA system into danger.

Disadvantages:: 
Since maintenance windows usually have longer time frames in between (for example once a month), systems might not be up-to-date from a security perspective.

Recommendation:: 
This is only a good strategy if important security updates are installed outside of the usual maintenance windows.


Selectively installing new updates and patches
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description:: 
A selective installation of patches and updates, for example of security updates only, further reduces the probability of installing problematic updates. 
This strategy is frequently combined with updating systems on a regular basis. 
The selective installation of packages can be performed using zypper, YaST or SUSE Manager.

Advantages:: 
The system is mostly up-to-date with (almost) all security patches installed.

Disadvantages:: 
Selecting packages has to be done manually and creates recurring effort, if one of the filters provided by zypper (for example cve number, category, severity) cannot be used.

Recommendation:: 
This is probably the best update strategy, but also the most complicated one.

TIP: An important issue with updates in most cases is the reboot and the involved downtime. 
Some kernel updates are shipped as live patches and do not require a reboot anymore.
More details can be found in the SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 Administration Guide, section 8 Live Kernel Patching with KLP.

Not updating
^^^^^^^^^^^^
Description:: 
A system is not registered to the SUSE update channels and no updates are applied.

Advantages: 
This has only disadvantages. 

Disadvantages:: 
Constantly increasing number of known security vulnerabilities make the system an ideal target for hacker attacks.

Recommendation:: 
We strongly recommend to subscribe to the SUSE update channels and to install at least security-updates on a regular basis.

Which update strategy fits best for the SAP HANA systems in an organization heavily depends on the corporate updating & patching policies / guidelines.
It also depends on the requirements of a particular SAP HANA system. For important SAP HANA systems, a more conservative update strategy should be chosen. 
For test systems, updates might even be applied automatically, for example by using YOU (YaST Online Update), on a regular basis.

Outlook
-------
Even though this guide already covers most security hardening topics, we are planning to provide further improvements. 
Also, later versions of SAP HANA might have changed, or new requirements regarding the hardening settings, the firewall or the minimal package selection might apply in future. 
It is planned to incorporate these new requirements as soon as they occur.

We recommend to check for updated versions of this document from time to time at the SUSE documentation pages at https://documentation.suse.com.
