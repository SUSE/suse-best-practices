# tag::harvester-intro[]
{harvester} is an open-source hyperconverged infrastructure (HCI) software that simplifies the management of virtual machines (VMs) and containerized workloads on bare metal servers. This cloud-native virtualization platform leverages core open-source technologies like Linux, KVM (Kernel-based Virtual Machine), Kubernetes, KubeVirt, and Longhorn, offering a flexible and cost-effective alternative to traditional virtualization.

=== Setting up {harvester}

Please follow the instructions on:
link:https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/[official website for {harvester}]
to get more information how to setup {harvester}.

NOTE: Make sure you meet the hardware requirements specified in 
https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/install/requirements
to set up your {harvester} environments.

=== Integrating {harvester} into {rancher}

IMPORTANT: Make sure you checked the support matrix at and use a supported {rancher} version:
https://www.suse.com/suse-harvester/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/harvester-v1-4-x/

To benefit from the synergies {rancher} and {harvester} can create, you need to import your {harvester} in the {rancher} UI.
To do so, follow the steps described at:
link:https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/rancher/virtualization-management[Importing Harvester cluster]

=== Uploading images to {harvester}

To find information how to upload images to {harvester} that will be used to spin up virtual machines, please refer to:

https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/image/upload-image

WARNING: Make sure to only use OS images that are supported with {harvester}.
You can get an overview of the currently supported images at https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/vm/virtual-machines .

# tag::harvester-kubernetes-storage[]

A benefit of using {harvester} is the provisioning of storage to your Kubernetes clusters.
If you create a cluster as described in xref:SAP-Rancher-RKE2-Installation.adoc#installRKE2Harvester[the previous chapter], a storageClass will automatically be created within your Kubernetes cluster.

# end::harvester-kubernetes-storage[]


# tag::harvester-lb[]

You can use {harvester} to create a guest Kubernetes cluster load balancer as also described at 
https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/networking/loadbalancer#guest-kubernetes-cluster-load-balancer
and
https://docs.harvesterhci.io/v1.4/rancher/cloud-provider/#load-balancer-support .

== Creating an IP Pool in {harvester}

To create an IP Pool, login to your {harvester} instance and go to *Networks -> IP Pools*.
Click on *Create* in the upper right corner to create a new IP Pool:

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-IPPool-Empty.png[scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

On the next screen, you should see a menu like this:

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-IPPool-Create.png[scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

Click on *Edit as YAML* and adjust the IP Pool to your needs.

Here's an example for such an IP Pool:

[source, yaml]
----
apiVersion: loadbalancer.harvesterhci.io/v1beta1
kind: IPPool
metadata:
  name: example
spec:
  selector:
    network: default/vlan11
    scope:
      - guestCluster: '*'
        namespace: '*'

  ranges:
    - gateway: 192.17.218.1
      rangeEnd: 192.17.218.30
      rangeStart: 192.17.218.5
      subnet: 192.17.218.1/22
      type: range
----

When you're done, click the *Create* button at the bottom right.

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-IPPool-Example.png[scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

At this point your IP Pool should have been created and show up in list of IP Pools:

This section describes how to set up a load balancer using {harvester} to distribute traffic to virtual machines.

IMPORTANT: This approach only works with {harvester} 1.4.2 or higher and requires that the target virtual machines are connected to the management network of {harvester}. 

If your management network is not managed by a DHCP, your first step would be to create an IP Pool.

# end::rancher-harvester-lb-intro[]


# tag::rancher-harvester-lb-config[]

To create a Load Balancer, login to your {harvester} instance and go to *Networks -> Load Balancers*.
Click on *Create* in the upper right corner to create a new Load Balancer:

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-LB-Empty.png[scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

On the next screen, you should see a menu like this:

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-LB-Create.png[scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

Select the IPAM method you want to use - either DHCP or Pool.

// TODO image

<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

Next configure the *Listeners*. The *Port* is the port on which the Load Balancer will listen for requests. The *Backend Port* will be the port of the target virtual machine the traffic is forwarded to.
If you want to use this Load Balancer to forward traffic to a {rancher} management cluster, you'd need to configure two listeners:

[options="header"]
|===
|Name |Protocol|Port|Backend Port
|http|TCP|80|80
|https|TCP|443|443
|===

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-LB-Listeners.png[scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]


++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

The next step is to configure the *Backend Server Selector*.
Here you'll configure which virtual machines are getting addressed by the Load Balancer.
Therefore the *Key* and *Value* must match the *Instance Labels* of the target virtual machines.
