=== Connecting {harvester} with {rancher}

To connect {harvester} with {rancher}, the first step is to access Rancher.
The menu in the upper left corner allows you to open the Virtualization Management tab.

After clicking the "Create" button, three steps to be executed on the {harvester} cluster are shown.



=== Provisioning virtual machines with RKE2

After {rancher} and {harvester} are connected, virtual machines can be provisioned using {rancher}.
To do so, access {rancher} and click "Create" in the home tab. Select the option "Harvester" and make sure
that RKE2/K3s is selected.

Next, the "Cluster: Create Harvester" page is loaded.

The first step you perform here is to set the cluster name.
The "Machine Pools" section specifies the number of machines to be provisioned, their Kubernetes role, and further VM specific parameters.

The "Cluster Configuration" section allows you to set some Kubernetes-specific parameters.
Here, select the Kubernetes version to fulfill the requirements of the desired workload.
