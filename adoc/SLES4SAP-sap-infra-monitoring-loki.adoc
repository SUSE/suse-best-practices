===== Loki

https://grafana.com/oss/loki/[Loki] is a log aggregation system, inspired by Prometheus and designed to be cost effective and easy to operate.
Unlike other logging systems, Loki is built around the idea of only indexing a set of metadata (labels) for logs and leaving the original log message unindexed.
Log data itself is then compressed and stored in chunks in object stores, for example locally on the file system.
A small index and highly compressed chunks simplify the operation and significantly lower the cost of Loki.

=== Loki
The Loki RPM packages can be found in the PackageHub repository.
The repository needs to be activated via the SUSEConnect command first, unless you have activated it in the previous steps already.
----
# SUSEConnect --product PackageHub/15.3/x86_64
----

Loki can then be installed via the `zypper` command:
----
# zypper in loki
----

Edit the Loki configuration file `/etc/loki/loki.yaml` and change the following lines:
[source]
----
chunk_store_config:
  max_look_back_period: 240h

table_manager:
  retention_deletes_enabled: true
  retention_period: 240h
----

Start and enable Loki service:
----
# systemctl enable --now loki.service
----

# end::loki-impl[]



// Loki practical usecases
# tag::loki-alert[]

==== Loki alerts
Loki supports Prometheus-compatible alerting rules. They are following the same syntax, except they use LogQL for their expressions.
To activate alerting the loki config needs a component called ruler:

.loki.yaml
[source]
-----
# Loki defaults to running in multi-tenant mode.
# Multi-tenant mode is set in the configuration with:
# auth_enabled: false
# When configured with "auth_enabled: false", Loki uses a single tenant.
# The single tenant ID will be the string fake.
auth_enabled: false
[...]

ruler:
  wal:
    dir: /loki/ruler-wal
  storage:
    type: local
    local:
      directory: /etc/loki/rules
  rule_path: /tmp/loki-rules-scratch
  alertmanager_url: http://alertmanager:9093
  enable_alertmanager_v2: true
-----

Depending on the given directory path in our example above, the rule file has to be stored under:

 /etc/loki/rules/fake/rules.yml

NOTE: We are using `auth_enabled: false` and therefore the default tenant ID is `fake` which needs to be add
      to the path the rules are stored.

The example rule below will trigger a mail (vial alertmanager configuration) if the password failed after accessing via ssh.
The log line looks like the following:

 2023-07-19T10:41:38.076428+02:00 nuc5 sshd[16723]: Failed password for invalid user charly from 192.168.1.201 port 58831 ssh2

    - name: accessLog
      rules:
        - alert: Failed_user_found
          expr: 'sum(
