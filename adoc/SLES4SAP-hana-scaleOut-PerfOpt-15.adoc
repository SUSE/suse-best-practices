== About this guide

=== Introduction

{sles4sapReg} is optimized in various
ways for {SAPreg} applications. This guide provides detailed information about
installing and customizing _{sles4sap}_
for {saphana} scale-out system replication automation in the performance
optimized scenario.

High availability is an important aspect of running your mission-critical
{saphana} servers.

The {saphana} scale-out system replication is a synchronization of all data in
{saphana} to a second {saphana} system. The {saphana} itself replicates all of
its data to a secondary {saphana} instance. It is an out-of-the-box, standard
feature.

The recovery time objective (RTO) is minimized through the data replication at
regular intervals. {saphana} supports asynchronous and synchronous modes. The
document at hand describes the synchronous replication from memory into memory
of the second system. This is the only method that allows the cluster to make a
decision based on coded algorithms.


=== Abstract

This guide describes planning, setup, and basic testing of {sles4sap} {prodNr}
for the high availability solution scenario "SAP HANA Scale-Out System
Replication Performance Optimized".

From the application perspective the following variants are covered:

- Plain system replication
- Multi-tier (chained) system replication
- Multi-target system replication
- Multi-tenant database containers for all above
- HANA host auto-failover for all above
- HANA databases without host auto-failover are possible, but not explained
  in this guide
// TODO PRIO3: - System replication with secondary site read-enabled

From the infrastructure perspective the following variants are covered:

- 3-site cluster with disk-based and diskless SBD fencing
- 1-site cluster with disk-based and diskless SBD fencing

== Scope of this documentation
This document describes how to set up automation of an {saphana} scale-out
system replication cluster installed on two sites based on {sles4sap} {pn15} {psp15}.
This concept can also be used with {sles4sap} {pn15} SP1 or newer.

To give a better overview the installation and setup is subdivided into
seven steps.

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> <<SAPHanaHsr>> <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase0.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

- Planning (section <<Planning>>)
- OS setup (section <<OsSetup>>)
- {saphana} installation (section <<SAPHanaInst>>)
- {saphana} system replication configuration (section <<SAPHanaHsr>>)
- {saphana} cluster integration (section <<Integration>>)
- {sles4sapAbbr} cluster configuration (section <<Cluster>>)
- Testing (section <<Testing>>)

After the setup process you will have a {sles4sap} cluster controlling
two 'swarms' of {saphana} scale-out in a system replication configuration.
The architecture is named the 'performance optimized scenario'.

.Cluster with {SAPHana} SR - performance optimized
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Cluster.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

With SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut, various HANA scale-out configurations are supported.
Details on requirements and supported scenarios are given below.
// TODO PRIO3: internal link to requirements section
In this guide, we describe two scenarios where {saphana} is configured for host
auto-failover. That means there are standby nodes which are managed by {saphana}.
A dedicated setup guide describes how to manage a specific HANA scale-out
configuration without standby-nodes. You will find background information on that
setup in a series of blog articles on {#towardsZeroDowntime}, for example 
https://www.suse.com/c/sap-hana-scale-out-system-replication-for-large-erp-systems/ .

NOTE: For upgrading an existing {saphana} scale-out system replication cluster
from SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut version 0.160, consult manual page
SAPHanaSR-manageAttr(8) and the blog article
https://www.suse.com/c/sap-hana-scale-out-multi-target-upgrade/ .


== Planning the installation

.Planning <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> <<SAPHanaHsr>> <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase1.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

[[Planning]] Planning the installation is essential for a successful {saphana} cluster setup.

What you need before you start:
// TODO PRIO3: (all) should we change from NFS to something more neutral in the following list like replacing 'NFS storage pools' by 'SAP HANA certified storage pools'?

- Software from {suse}: {sles4sap} installation media and a valid subscription
  for getting updates
- Software from {sap}: {saphana} installation media
- Physical or virtual systems including disks and NFS storage pools (see below)
- Filled parameter sheet (see below)

=== Minimum lab requirements and prerequisites

This section defines some minimum requirements to install {saphana} scale-out.

NOTE: The minimum lab requirements mentioned here are no SAP sizing information.
These data are provided only to rebuild the described cluster in a lab for test purposes.
Even for such tests the requirements can increase depending on your test scenario.
For productive systems ask your hardware vendor or use the official SAP sizing
tools and services.

NOTE: Refer to {saphana} TDI documentation for allowed storage
configuration and file systems.

.Simplified NFS share structure of a 2+1:2+1 {saphana} system replication
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-NFSPool-2+1.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

Requirements with 3 {SAPHANA} instances per site (2+1 : 2+1) - with a
majority maker:

- 6 VMs with each 32 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space
- 1 VM with 2 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space
- 1 shared disk for SBD with 10 MB disk space
- 2 NFS pools (one per site) with a capacity of each 96 GB
- 1 additional IP address for takeover

.Simplified NFS share structure of a 3+2:3+2 {saphana} system replication
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-NFSPool-3+2.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

Requirements with 5 {SAPHANA} instances per site (3+2 : 3+2) -
with a majority maker:

- 10 VMs with each 32 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space
- 1 VM with 2 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space
- 1 shared disk for SBD with 10 MB disk space
- 2 NFS pools (one per site) with a capacity of each 132 GB
- 1 additional IP address for takeover

// pools size is calculated like:
//     shared = 1 * MEM
//     data   = NODES * 1   * MEM
//     log    =  NODES * 1/2 * MEM
//     pool = shared + data + log

//For the SBD based fencing the setup needs a pool (1 up to 3) of shared
//disks to allow the transportation of the "poison pills".

The SBD based fencing needs up to 3 shared block devices.

.Additionally to the NFS shares: All cluster nodes need to have access to the SBD block devices
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-SBDs-3+2.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

=== Parameter sheet

The cluster organizing two {saphana} 'swarms' is quite complex. The installation
should be planned properly. You should have all needed parameters like SID, IP
addresses and much more already in place. It is a good practice to first fill out
the parameter sheet and than begin with the installation.

=== Scale-out scenario and resource agents

To automate the failover, the High Availability Extension built into
_{sles4sap}_ is used. Two resource agents have been created to handle the scenario.

The first is the *SAPHanaController* resource agent (RA), which checks and
manages the {saphana} database instances. This RA is configured as a
multi-state resource.

The master assumes responsibility for the active master name server of the
{saphana} database running in primary mode. All other instances are
represented by the slave mode.

.Cluster resource agents and multi-state status mapping
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Cluster-Resources02.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

The second resource agent is *SAPHanaTopology*. This RA has been created to make configuring the cluster as simple as possible.
It runs on all nodes (except the majority maker)
of a {sle} High Availability Extension {pn15} cluster. It gathers information
about the statuses and configurations of the {saphana} system replication. It is
designed as a normal (stateless) clone resource.

With the current version of resource agents, {SAPHANA} system replication for
scale-out is supported in the following scenarios or use cases:

Performance optimized, single container (A => B)::
This scenario and setup is described in this document. In the performance
optimized scenario an {saphana} RDBMS on site "A" is synchronizing with an
{saphana} RDBMS on a second site "B". As the {saphana} RDBMS on the second site
is configured to preload the tables the takeover time is typically very short.
See also the requirements section below for details.

Performance optimized, multi-tenancy also named MDC (%A => %B)::
Multi-tenancy is available for all of the supported scenarios and use cases in
this document. This scenario is supported since {SAPHANA} 1 SPS12, it is the
default installation type for {SAPHANA} 2.0.
The setup and configuration from a cluster point of view is the same for
multi-tenancy and single containers. The one caveat is, that the tenants are
managed all together by the Linux cluster. See also the requirements section
below.

Multi-Tier Replication (A => B -> C)::
A Multi-Tier system replication has an additional target, which must be
connected to the secondary (chain topology). This is a special case of the
Multi-Target replication. Because of the mandatory chain topology, the RA
feature AUTOMATED_REGISTER=true is not possible with pure Multi-Tier replication.
See also the requirements section below.

Multi-Target Replication (A <= B -> C)::
A Multi-Target system replication has an additional target, which is connected to
either the secondary (chain topology) or to the primary (star topology).
Multi-Target replication is possible since {SAPHANA} 2.0 SPS04.
See also the requirements section below.


=== The concept of the Performance Optimized Scenario

In case of failure of the primary {saphana} on site 1 the cluster first tries to
start the takeover process. This allows to use the already loaded data at the
secondary site. Typically the takeover is much faster than the local restart.

A site is noticed as "down" or "on error", if the *LandscapeHostConfiguration
status* reflects this (return code 1). This happens when worker nodes are going
down without any {SAPHANA} standby nodes left. Standby nodes are designed to
perform a host auto-failover for the worker functionality.
Find more details on concept and implementation in manual page
SAPHanaSR-ScaelOut(7).

Without any additional intervention the resource agent will wait for the {sap}
internal HA cluster to repair the situation locally. An additional intervention
could be a custom python hook using the SAP provider *srServiceStateChanged()*
available since {SAPHANA} 2.0 SPS01.

To achieve an automation of this resource handling process, use the
{SAPHANA} resource agents included in the _SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut_ RPM package
delivered with {sles4sap}.

You can configure the level of automation by setting the parameter
_AUTOMATED_REGISTER_. If automated registration is activated the cluster will
also automatically register a former failed primary to get the new secondary.
Find configuration details in manual page ocf_suse_SAPHanaController(7).

=== Important prerequisites

Read the SAP Notes and papers first.

The _SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut_ resource agent software package
supports scale-out (multiple-box to multiple-box) system replication with the
following configurations and parameters:
// TODO PRIO2: align prerequisites section with scale-up guide and man pages

* The cluster must include a valid STONITH method.
  SBD disk-based or diskless is recommended STONITH method.
* Both sites are either in the same network segment (layer 2) to allow an easy
  takeover of an IP Address, or you need a technique like overlay IP addresses
  in virtual private clouds.
* Technical users and groups, such as _{refsidadm}_ are defined *locally* in the
  Linux system.
* Name resolution of the cluster nodes and the virtual IP address should be done
  *locally* on *all* cluster nodes to not depend on DNS services (as it can
  fail, too).
* Time synchronization between the cluster nodes using reliable time services
  like NTP.
* Both {saphana} sites have the same SAP Identifier (SID) and instance number.
* The {SAPHANA} scale-out system must have only *one* active master name server
  per site. It should have up to three master name server candidates ({SAPHANA}
  nodes with a configured role 'master<N>').
* For {SAPHANA} databases without additional master name server candidate,
  the package SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut version 0.180 or newer is needed.
* The {SAPHANA} scale-out system must have only *one* failover group.
* There is maximum one additional {saphana} system replication connected from
  outside the Linux cluster. Thus two sites are managed by the Linux cluster,
  one site outside is recognized. For {SAPHANA} multi-tier and multi-target
  system replication, the package SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut version 0.180 or newer is needed.
* Only one {SAPHANA} SID is installed. Thus the performance optimized setup is
  supported. But the cost optimized and MCOS scenarios are currently not supported.
* The _{sapHostAgent}_ must be running. _{sapHostAgent}_ is needed to translate
  between the system node names and SAP host names used during the installation
  of {saphana}. For SystemV style, the sapinit script needs to be active.
// TODO PRIO1: publish the below, once SAP ships systemd integration for HANA  
// For systemd style, the
// services saphostagent and SAP<SID>_<INO> can stay enabled. The systemd enabled
// saphostagent and instance´s sapstartsrv is supported from SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut 0.181 onwards.
// Please refer to the OS documentation for the systemd version. Please refer to {sap}
// documentation for the {sap} HANA version. Combining systemd style hostagent with
// SystemV style instance is allowed. However, all nodes in one Linux cluster have to
// use the same style.
* All {saphana} instances controlled by the cluster must not be activated via
  _sapinit_ auto-start.
* The replication mode should be either 'sync' or 'syncmem'. But 'async' is not
  supported.
* The Linux cluster can be either freshly installed as described in this guide,
  or it can be upgraded as described in respective documentation.
  Not allowed is mixing old and new cluster attributes or hook scripts within
  one Linux cluster.

Find more details in the REQUIREMENTS section of manual pages
SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut(7), ocf_suse_SAPHanaController(7),
SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py(7) and SAPHanaSR-manageAttr(8).

[IMPORTANT]
====
Automated registration of a failed primary after takeover is possible. But as a
good starting configuration for projects, it is recommended to *switch off* the
automated registration of a failed primary, therefore the
`AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"` is the *default*.

In this case, you need to register a failed primary after a takeover manually.
Use SAP tools like {SAPHANA} Cockpit or *hdbnsutil*.
// DONE PRIO3: Should we add also hana cockpit here?
====

* For optimal automation, _AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"_ is recommended.
* Automated start of {SAPHANA} instances during system boot must be switched
  *off*.
* You need at least SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut version 0.180, {sles4sap} {pn15} SP1 and
  {SAPHANA} 2.0 SPS 4 for all mentioned setups.

IMPORTANT: You must implement a valid STONITH method. Without a valid STONITH
method, the complete cluster is unsupported and will not work properly.

In this setup guide, NFS is used as storage for the {saphana} database. This
has been chosen for simplicity. However, any storage supported by {saphana} and
the {saphana} storage API can be used. Refer to the {saphana} TDI
documentation for supported storage and follow the respective storage vendor's 
configuration instructions.

This setup guide focuses on the performance optimized setup as it is the
only supported scale-out scenario at the point of writing this guide.

If you need to implement a different scenario, it is strongly recommended to
define a Proof-of-Concept (PoC) with {SUSE}. This PoC will focus on testing
the existing solution in your scenario. The limitation of most of the above
items is mostly due to testing limits.


== Setting up the operating system

.<<Planning>> OsSetup <<SAPHanaInst>> <<SAPHanaHsr>> <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase2.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

[[OsSetup]]This section includes information you should consider during the
installation of the operating system.

In this document, first {sles4sap} is installed and configured. Then the {saphana}
database including the system replication is set up. Finally the
automation with the cluster is set up and configured.

// TODO PRIO3: SAP notes reference - each note mentioned here should also be added to the appendix


=== Installing {sles4sap}

Multiple installation guides are already existing, with different reasons to set up the server in a certain way. 
Below it is outlined where this information can be found.
In addition, you will find important details you should consider to get a system which is well prepared to deliver {sapHana}.

==== Installing the base operating system

Depending on your infrastructure and the hardware used, you need to adapt the installation.
All supported installation methods and minimum requirement are described in the _Deployment Guide_
({deploymentGuide15}).
In case of automated installations you can find further information in the _AutoYaST Guide_
({autoYastGuide15}).
The major installation guide for {sles4sap} to fit all requirements for {sapHana} is described in the
SAP notes:

// SUSE and SAP are kept literal here not by the reference, because its a quote of an external title
- {sapnote15} SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15: Installation Note and
- {sapnoteset15} SAP HANA DB: Recommended OS settings for SLES 15 / SLES for SAP Applications 15


==== Installing additional software
{SUSE} delivers with {sles4sap} special resource agents for {sapHana}. With the pattern _sap-hana_ the resource
agent for {sapHana} *ScaleUp* is installed. For the *ScaleOut* scenario you need a special resource agent.
Follow the instructions below on each node if you have installed the systems based on SAP note {sapnoteset15}.
The pattern _High Availability_ summarizes all tools recommended to be installed on *all* nodes, including the
_majority maker_.

* remove package: patterns-sap-hana, {sapHanaSR}, yast2-sap-ha
* install package: {sapHanaSR}-ScaleOut, {sapHanaSR}-ScaleOut-doc
* install pattern: ha_sles

To do so, for example, use Zypper:

// SUSE is kept literal here, because it is a quote from a command output
.Uninstall the {sapHanaSR} agent for ScaleUP

====

==== Getting the latest updates

If you have installed the packages before, make sure to deploy the newest updates
on *all* machines to have the latest versions of the resource agents and other
packages. A prerequisite is a valid subscription for {sles4sap}. There are multiple
ways to get updates via {SUSE} Manager, the Repository Management Tool (RMT), or
via a direct connection to the {SUSE} Customer Center (SCC).

Depending on your company or customer rules, use `zypper update` or `zypper patch`.

.Software update must be triggered from each node
====
The command `zypper patch` will install all available needed patches.
As user root, type:

----
# zypper patch
----

The command `zypper update` will update all or specified installed packages with
newer versions, if possible. As user root, type:

----
# zypper update

====

=== Configuring {sles4sap} to run {sapHana}

==== Tuning or modifying the operating system

Operating system tuning are described in SAP note {sapnoteprep} and
{sapnoteset15}.
The SAP note {sapnoteprep} explains three ways to implementing the settings.

.Using saptune (preferred)
====
[subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
# saptune solution apply HANA
----
====

==== Enabling SSH access via public key (optional)
Public key authentication provides SSH users access to their servers without entering their passwords.
SSH keys are also more secure than passwords, because the private key used to secure the connection
is never shared. Private keys can also be encrypted. Their encrypted contents cannot easily be read.
For the document at hand, a very simple but useful setup is used. This setup is based on
only one ssh-key pair which enables SSH access to all cluster nodes.

NOTE: Follow your company security policy to set up access to the systems.

.SSH key creation and exchange
====
As user root create an SSH key on one node.

----
# ssh-keygen -t rsa
----

The ssh-key generation asks for missing parameters.

----
Generating public/private rsa key pair.
Enter file in which to save the key (/root/.ssh/id_rsa):
Enter passphrase (empty for no passphrase):
Enter same passphrase again:
Your identification has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.
Your public key has been saved in /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub.
The key fingerprint is:
SHA256:ip/8kdTbYZNuuEUAdsaYOAErkwnkAPBR7d2SQIpIZCU root@<host1>
The key's randomart image is:
+---[RSA 2048]----+
|XEooo+ooo+o      |
|=+.= o=.o+.      |
|..B o. + o.      |
|   (°<           |
|  /  )           |
|   --            |
|   B. . o o =    |
|     o . . +     |
|      +.. .      |
+----[SHA256]-----+
----

After the `ssh-keygen` is set up, you will have two new files under `/root/.ssh/` .

----
# ls /root/.ssh/
id_rsa  id_rsa.pub
----

To allow password-free access for the user root between nodes in the cluster copy `id_rsa.pub` to `authorized_keys` and set the required permissions.

----
# cp /root/.ssh/id_rsa.pub /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
# chmod 600 /root/.ssh/authorized_keys
----

Collect the public host keys from all other node. For the document at hand, the _ssh-keyscan_ command is used.

----
# ssh-keyscan
----

The SSH host key is automatically collected and stored in the file `/root/.ssh/known_host` during the first SSH
connection. To avoid to confirm the first login with "yes", which accepts the host key, collect and store
them beforehand.

----
# ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 <host1>,<host1 ip> >>.ssh/known_hosts
# ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 <host2>,<host2 ip> >>.ssh/known_hosts
# ssh-keyscan -t ecdsa-sha2-nistp256 <host3>,<host3 ip> >>.ssh/known_hosts
...
----

After collecting all host keys push the entire directory `/root/.ssh/` from the first node to all further cluster members.

----
# rsync -ay /root/.ssh/ <host2>:/root/.ssh/
# rsync -ay /root/.ssh/ <host3>:/root/.ssh/
# rsync -ay /root/.ssh/ <host4>:/root/.ssh/
...

==== Setting up disk layout for {sapHana}

An SAP certified storage system with a validated storage
API is generally recommended. This is a prerequisite of a stable and reliable scale-out installation.

- /hana/shared/{refSID}
- /hana/data/{refSID}
- /hana/log/{refSID}

// TODO PRIO3: (FH) Picture showing the nodes/swarms consuming the NFS pools and shares.

Create the mount directories on all {saphana} nodes.
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# mkdir -p /hana/shared/{refSID}
# mkdir -p /hana/data/{refSID}
# mkdir -p /hana/log/{refSID}
# mkdir -p /usr/sap
----

The {saphana} installation needs a special storage setup. The NFS setup used for
this guide must be reboot-persistent. You can achieve this with entries in the
`/etc/fstab`.

NOTE: NFS version 4 is required in the setup at hand.

.Create permanent mount entries for all NFS pools
==========

Create _/etc/fstab_ entries for the three NFS pools.

File systems

/hana/shared/{refSID}::
The mount directory is used for shared files between all hosts in an {SAPHANA}
system. This directory needs to be accessible to each of the servers in the
{SAPHANA} cluster.

/hana/log/{refSID}::
The default path to the log directory depends on the system ID of the {SAPHANA}
host.

/hana/data/{refSID}::
The default path to the data directory depends on the system ID of the {SAPHANA}
host.

/usr/sap::
This is the path to the local SAP system instance directories. It is possible
to join this location with the Linux installation.

/sapsoftware:: (optional)
Space for copying the SAP install software media. This NFS pool is mounted on both sites and contains
the {sapHana} installation media and installation parameter files.

Set up host name resolution for all machines.

You can either use a DNS server or modify the _/etc/hosts_ on *all* nodes.

With maintaining the `/etc/hosts` file, you minimize the impact of a failing
DNS service. Replace the IP address and the host name in the following commands.

[subs="quotes,attributes"]
----
vi /etc/hosts
----

Insert the following lines to `/etc/hosts`. Change the IP address and host name
to match your environment.

Simply enable an *ntp service* on all node in the cluster to have proper time
synchronization.

== Installing the {saphana} databases on both sites

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> SAPHanaInst <<SAPHanaHsr>> <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase3.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

[[SAPHanaInst]]The infrastructure is set up. Now install the {saphana} database on
both sites. In a cluster a machine is also called a _node_.

.Procedure

. Install the {hana} database on all {hana} nodes.

. Check if the SAP hostagent is installed on all {hana} nodes.

. Verify that both databases are up and running.

In the example at hand, to make it easier to follow the documentation, the
machines (or nodes) are named _{mySite1FirstNode}_, ... _suseXX_. The nodes with odd numbers
(suse01, suse03, suse05, ...) will be part of site "A" ({mySite1Name}) and the nodes with even numbers
(suse02, suse04, suse06, ...) will be part of site "B"({mySite2Name}) .

The following users are automatically created during the {saphana} installation:

{refsidadm}::
The user{refsidadm} is the operating system user required for administrative
tasks, such as starting and stopping the system.
sapadm::
The SAP Host Agent administrator.
SYSTEM::
The {saphana} database superuser.

// TODO PRIO3: Add also groups?

=== Install the {hana} database

- Read the SAP Installation and Setup Manuals available at the SAP Marketplace.

- Download the {SAPHANA} Software from SAP Marketplace.

- Mount the file systems to install {SAPHANA} database software and database
  content (data and log).

- Start the installtion.

// === Installation

. Mount /hana/shared from the nfs server.
+
[subs="specialchars,quotes,attributes"]
----
# for system in suse0{1,2,3,4,5,6}; do
    ssh $system mount -a
done
----
+
. Install the {saphana} Database as described in the {SAPHANA} Server
Installation Guide on *all* machines (two sites) except the majority maker.
Both databases need to have same SID and instance number.
You can use either the graphical user interface or the command line
installer _hdblcm_. The command line installer can be used in an interactive
or batch mode. 
// TODO PRIO3: Use an answer file instead or provide it in the appendix
+
.Using hdblcm in interactive mode
==============================
----
# <path_to_sap_media>/hdblcm
----
==============================
+
Alternatively you can also use the batch mode of _hdblcm_. This can either be
done by specifying all needed parameters via the command line or by using a
parameter file.
+
In the example at hand the command line parameters are used. In the batch mode you
need to provide an XML password file (here <path>/hana_passwords). A template of this
password file can be created with the following command:
+

.Creating a password file
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# <path_to_sap_media>/hdblcm --dump_configfile_template=templateFile
----
==========
+
This command creates two files:
+
--
* _templateFile_ is the template for a parameter file.
* _templateFile.xml_ is the XML template used to provide several hana_passwords
to the hdblcm installer.
--
+

The XML password file looks as follows:
+

.The XML password template
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<!-- Replace the 3 asterisks with the password -->
<Passwords>
    <root_password><![CDATA[***]]></root_password>

    <master_password><![CDATA[***]]></master_password>
    <sapadm_password><![CDATA[***]]></sapadm_password>
    <password><![CDATA[***]]></password>
    <system_user_password><![CDATA[***]]></system_user_password>

    <ase_user_password><![CDATA[***]]></ase_user_password>
    <org_manager_password><![CDATA[***]]></org_manager_password>
</Passwords>
----
==========
+

After having created the XML password file, you can immediately start the
{saphana} installation in batch mode by providing all needed parameters via
the command line.
+
.Using hdblcm in batch mode
==============================
In the example below the password file is used to provide the password during the installation dialog.
All installation parameters are named directly as one command.
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]

== Setting up {SAPHANA} system replication

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> SAPHanaHsr <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase4.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

[[SAPHanaHsr]]This section describes the setup of the system replication (HSR) after {saphana} has
been installed properly.

.Procedure

. Back up the primary database
. Enable the primary database
. Register the secondary database
. Verify the system replication

For more information read the Section _Setting Up System Replication_ of the
{saphana} Administration Guide.

=== Backing up the primary database
First back up the primary database as described in the
_{saphana} Administration Guide, Section {saphana} Database Backup and Recovery_.

Below find examples to back up {saphana} with SQL Commands:

.Simple backup for the system database and all tenants with one singe backup call
=========================
As user {refsidadm} enter the following command:

----
~> hdbsql -i {refInst} -u SYSTEM -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR FULL SYSTEM USING FILE ('backup')"
----

You get the following command output (or similar):

----
0 rows affected (overall time 15.352069 sec; server time 15.347745 sec)
----
=========================

.Simple backup for a single container (non-MDC) database
=========================
Enter the following command as user {refsidadm}:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbsql -i {refInst} -u <dbuser> \
   "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('backup')"
----
=========================

////
.Back up the system database only
=========================
----
~> hdbsql -i <inst> -u <dbuser> -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA ALL USING FILE ('<path>')"
----
=========================

.Back up a tenant using a systemdb database user
=========================
----
~> hdbsql -i <instnr> -u <dbuser> -d SYSTEMDB \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR <DBNAME> USING FILE ('<path>')"
----
=========================

.Back up the tenant using a tenant database user
=========================
----
~> hdbsql -i <instnr> -u <dbuser> -d <tenantDBNAME> \
   "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('<path>’)”
----

=========================
////

////
If you have (for example) created a backup database user and a user key
_hanabackup_, you can create an initial backup of an MDC {SAPHANA} using the
following command:

----
~> hdbsql -U hanabackup \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR FULL SYSTEM USING FILE ('backup')"
----
////

IMPORTANT: Without a valid backup, you *cannot* bring {SAPHANA} into a system
replication configuration.

// TODO PRIO3: (BS) Add section about separate SR network. Only a hint not a
//    complete setup

=== Enabling the primary database
As Linux user _{refsidadm}_ enable the system replication at the primary node. You
need to define a site name (like _{mySite1Name}_) which must be unique for all {SAPHANA}
databases which are connected via system replication. This means the secondary
must have a different site name.

.Enable the system replication on the primary site
==========
As user {refsidadm} enable the primary:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name={mySite1Name}
----

Check if the command output is similar to:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
nameserver is active, proceeding ...
successfully enabled system as system replication source site
done.
----
==========

The command line tool _hdbnsutil_ can be used to check the system replication
mode and site name.

.Check the system replication configuration status as user {refsidadm} on the primary
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration
----

If the system replication enablement was successful at the primary, the
output should be as follows:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
checking for active or inactive nameserver ...
System Replication State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

mode: primary
site id: 1
site name: {mySite1Name}
done.
----
==========

The mode has changed from “none” to “primary” and the site now has a site name
and a site ID.

=== Registering the secondary database
The {saphana} database instance on the secondary side must be stopped before the
system can be registered for the system replication. You can use your
preferred method to stop the instance (like _HDB_ or _sapcontrol_). After the
database instance has been stopped successfully, you can register the instance
using _hdbnsutil_.

.Stop the secondary as Linux user _{refsidadm}_:
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> sapcontrol -nr {refInst} -function StopSystem
----
==========

// TODO PRIO3: Any need to adapt the following files to be "neutral" and not
// bound to a specific site or hostname? We need at least to change files for
// the XSA (see SAP Note xxxx)
// The files are in binary format but include the name 'suse01' (of the primary)

.Copy the KEY and KEY-DATA file from the primary to the secondary site
==========
The copy of key and key-data should only be done on the master name server.
As the files are in the global file space, you do not need to run the command
on all cluster nodes.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
cd /usr/sap/{refSID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs
rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/data/SSFS_{refSID}.DAT
rsync -va {,<node1-siteB>:}$PWD/key/SSFS_{refSID}.KEY
----
==========

// rsync -va {,suse02:}/usr/sap/HA1/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/data/SSFS_HA1.DAT
// rsync -va {,suse02:}/usr/sap/HA1/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs/key/SSFS_HA1.KEY

.Register the secondary as Linux user _{refsidadm}_:
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_register --name=<site2> \
     --remoteHost=<node1-siteA> --remoteInstance={refInst} \
     --replicationMode=sync --operationMode=logreplay
----

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
adding site ...
checking for inactive nameserver ...
nameserver {mySite2FirstNode}:30001 not responding.
collecting information ...
updating local ini files ...
done.
----
==========

The _remoteHost_ is the primary node in our case, the _remoteInstance_ is the
database instance number (here {myHANAInst}).

Now start the database instance again and verify the system replication status.
On the secondary site, the mode should be one of „SYNC“, „SYNCMEM“ or „ASYNC“.
The mode depends on the *sync* option defined during the registration of the
secondary.

.Start the system on the secondary site as user {refsidadm}
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> sapcontrol -nr {refInst} -function StartSystem
----

Wait until the {sapHana} database is started completely.
==========

.Check the system replication configuration as Linux user {refsidadm}
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration
----

The output should look like the following:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
System Replication State
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
mode: sync
site id: 2
site name: {mySite2Name}
active primary site: 1

primary masters: {suse01} {suse03} {suse05}
done.
----
==========


=== Verifying the system replication

To view the replication state of the whole {saphana} cluster, use the following
command as _{refsidadm}_ user on the primary site.

.Check the system replication status at the primary site (as {refsidadm})
=========
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py
----

This script prints a human-readable table of the system replication channels and their status. The
most interesting column is the **Replication Status**, which should be **ACTIVE**.

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> <<SAPHanaHsr>> Integration <<Cluster>> <<Testing>>
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase5.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

[[Integration]]Proceed with the following steps:

.Procedure

. Implement the HA/DR python hook {haDrMultiTargetPy}
. Configure system replication operation mode
. Allow {refsidadm} to access the cluster
. Start {saphana}
. Test the hook integration

=== Implementing the HA/DR provider hook {haDrMultiTargetPy}

// TODO PRIO3: explain new default SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py, even for non-multi-target

This step must be done on both sites. {SAPHANA} must be stopped to change the
_global.ini_ and allow {SAPHANA} to integrate the HA/DR hook script during start.

// TODO - Install the HA/DR hook script into a read/writable directory
- Integrate the hook into _global.ini_ ({saphana} needs to be stopped for doing that offline)
- Check integration of the hook during {SAPHANA} start-up

The ready-to-use HA/DR hook script is shipped with the SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut package in
directory /usr/share/SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut/.
The hook script must be available on all cluster nodes, including the majority
maker. Find more details in manual page SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py(7).

Stop {SAPHANA}.

===================================


=== Configuring the system replication operation mode

When your system is connected as an {sapHanaSR} target, you can find an entry
in the _global.ini_ file which defines the operation mode. Up to now there are
three modes available:

* _delta_datashipping_
* _logreplay_
* _logreplay_readaccess_

Until performing a takeover and re-registration in the opposite direction, the
entry for the operation mode is missing on your primary site. The default and
preferred mode for HA is _logreplay_.
Using the operation mode _logreplay_ makes your secondary site in the {saphana}
system replication a hot standby system.
For more details regarding both modes check the SAP documentation such as
"How To Perform System Replication for SAP HANA" (see https://www.sap.com/documents/2013/10/26c02b58-5a7c-0010-82c7-eda71af511fa.html).

Check both _global.ini_ files and add the operation mode, if needed.

=== Allowing {refsidadm} to access the cluster

// TODO PRIO2: align with manual page SAPHanaSrMultiTarget.py(7), also gsh
The current version of the {haDrMultiTargetPy} python hook uses the command
_sudo_ to allow the {refsidadm} user to access the cluster attributes. In Linux
you can use _visudo_ to start the vi editor for the Linux system */etc/sudoers*.
We recommend to use a specific file */etc/sudoers.d/SAPHanaSR* instead. That
file can be edited by plain vi, or handled by any configuration management.

The user {refsidadm} must be able to set the cluster attributes
hana_{refsidLC}_site_srHook_* and hana_{refsidLC}_gsh.
The {SAPHANA} system replication hook needs password free access. The following
example limits the sudo access to exactly setting the needed attribute.

Replace the {refsidLC} by the lowercase SAP system ID.

== Configuring the cluster and {SAPHANA} resources
[[Cluster]]This chapter describes the configuration of the {sleha} cluster. The {sleha} is part of {sles4sap}.
Further, the integration of {saphana} System Replication with the {sleha} cluster is explained. The integration is done
by using the SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut package which is also part of {sles4sap}.

. Installation of cluster packages
. Basic Cluster Configuration
. Configure Cluster Properties and Resources
. Final steps

=== Installing the cluster packages

If not already done, install the pattern _High Availability_ on *all* nodes.

To do so, use Zypper.
----
# zypper in -t pattern ha_sles
----

Now the Resource Agents for controlling the {saphana} system replication need
to be installed at *all* cluster nodes, including the majority maker.
----
# zypper in SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut
----

If you have the packages installed before, make sure to get the newest updates
on *all* nodes
----
zypper patch
----

=== Configuring the basic cluster

After having installed the cluster packages, the next step is to set up the basic cluster framework. For convenience, use
YaST or the _ha-cluster-init_ script.

[IMPORTANT]
It is strongly recommended to add a second corosync ring, implement unicast (UCAST)
communication and adjust the timeout values to your environment.

**Prerequisites**

* Name resolution
* Time synchronization
* Redundant network for cluster intercommunication
* STONITH method

==== Seting up watchdog for "Storage-based Fencing"
It is recommended to use SBD as central STONITH device, as done in the example at hand. Each node constantly monitors
connectivity to the storage device, and terminates itself in case the partition becomes unreachable.
Whenever SBD is used, a
correctly working watchdog is crucial. Modern systems support a hardware watchdog that needs to
be "tickled" or "fed" by a software component. The software component (usually a daemon) regularly
writes a service pulse to the watchdog. If the daemon stops feeding the watchdog, the hardware will
enforce a system restart. This protects against failures of the SBD process itself, such as dying, or
getting stuck on an I/O error.

.Set up for Watchdog
====
IMPORTANT: Access to the Watchdog Timer:
No other software must access the watchdog timer. Some hardware vendors ship systems management
software that uses the watchdog for system resets (for example, HP ASR daemon). Disable such
software, if watchdog is used by SBD.

Determine the right watchdog module. Alternatively, you can find a list of installed drivers with your
kernel version.

----
# ls -l /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/watchdog
----

Check if any watchdog module is already loaded.

----
# lsmod | egrep "(wd|dog|i6|iT|ibm)"
----

If you get a result, the system has already a loaded watchdog. If the watchdog does not match
your watchdog device, you need to unload the module.

To safely unload the module, check first if an application is using the watchdog device.

----
# lsof /dev/watchdog
# rmmod <wrong_module>
----

Enable your watchdog module and make it persistent. For the example below, _softdog_ has been used which has some
restrictions and should not be used as first option.

----
# echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
# systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
----

Check if the watchdog module is loaded correctly.

----
# lsmod | grep dog
----

Testing the watchdog can be done with a simple action. Ensure to switch of your {sapHana}
first because watchdog will force an unclean reset / shutdown of your system.

In case of a hardware watchdog a desired action is predefined after the timeout of the watchdog has
reached. If your watchdog module is loaded and not controlled by any other application, do the following:

IMPORTANT: Triggering the watchdog without continuously updating the watchdog resets/switches off the system.
      This is the intended mechanism. The following commands will force your system to be reset/switched off.

----
# touch /dev/watchdog
----

In case the softdog module is used the following action can be performed:

----
# echo 1 > /dev/watchdog
----

After your test was successful you can implement the watchdog on all cluster members. The example below
applies to the softdog module. Replace **<wrong_module>** by the module name queried before.

----
# for i in suse{02,03,04,05,06,-mm}; do
    ssh -T $i <<EOSSH
        hostname
        rmmod <wrong_module>
        echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
        systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
        lsmod |grep -e dog
EOSSH
done
----

====

==== Setting up the initial cluster using _ha-cluster-init_
For more detailed information about ha-cluster-* tools, see section _Overview of the Bootstrap Scripts_ of the Installation and Setup Quick Start Guide
for SUSE Linux Enterprise High Availability Extension at https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP1/single-html/SLE-HA-install-quick/#sec-ha-inst-quick-bootstrap.

Create an initial setup by using _ha-cluster-init_ command. Follow the dialog
steps.

NOTE: This is *only* to be done on the *first* cluster node. If you are using
SBD as STONITH mechanism, you need to first load the watchdog kernel module
matching your setup. In the example at hand the _softdog_ kernel module is used.


The command _ha_cluster-init_ configures the basic cluster framework including:

* SSH keys
* csync2 to transfer configuration files
* SBD (at least one device)
* corosync (at least one ring)
* HAWK Web interface


[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# ha-cluster-init -u -s <sbd-device>
----

As requested by _ha-cluster-init_, change the password of the user _hacluster_ on all cluster nodes.

NOTE: Do not forget to change the password of the user _hacluster_.

==== Cluster configuration for all other cluster nodes
The other nodes of the cluster could be integrated by starting the
command _ha-cluster-join_. This command asks for the IP address or name of
the *first* cluster node. Than all needed configuration files are copied over.
As a result the cluster is started on *all* nodes. Do not forget the majority maker.

If you are using SBD as STONITH method, you need to activate the _softdog_ kernel
module matching your systems. In the example at hand the _softdog_ kernel module is used.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# ha-cluster-join -c {refHost1}
----

==== Checking the cluster for the first time
Now it is time to check and optionally start the cluster for the first time on
all nodes.

NOTE: All nodes should be started in parallel. Otherwise unseen nodes might get fenced.

Check the cluster status with `crm_mon`. Use the option `-r` to also see
resources which are configured but stopped.
----
# crm_mon -r
----

The command will show the "empty" cluster and will print something like the
screen output below. The most interesting information in this output is that
there are two nodes in the status "online" and the message "partition with quorum".

=== Configuring cluster properties and resources
This section describes how to configure bootstrap, STONITH, resources, and constraints
using the _crm_ configure shell command as described in section
_Configuring and Managing Cluster Resources (Command Line)_ of the
{sleha} Administration Guide (see https://documentation.suse.com/sle-ha/15-SP1/html/SLE-HA-all/cha-ha-manual-config.html).

Use the command _crm_ to add the objects to the Cluster Resource Management
(CRM). Copy the following examples to a local file and then load the
configuration to the Cluster Information Base (CIB). The benefit is that
you have a scripted setup and a backup of your configuration.

Perform all _crm_ commands only on *one* node, for example on machine {mySite1FirstNode}.

First write a text file with the configuration, which you load into your cluster
in a second step. This step is as follows:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# vi crm-file<XX>
# crm configure load update crm-file<XX>
----

==== Cluster bootstrap and more
The first example defines the cluster bootstrap options including the resource and
operation defaults.

The `stonith-timeout` should be greater than 1.2 times the SBD `msgwait` timeout.
Find more details and examples in manual page SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut_basic_cluster(7).

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# vi crm-bs.txt
----

Enter the following to _crm-bs.txt_:

----
property cib-bootstrap-options: \
    have-watchdog=true \
    cluster-infrastructure=corosync \
    cluster-name=hacluster \
    placement-strategy=balanced \
    no-quorum-policy=freeze \
    stonith-enabled=true \
    concurrent-fencing=true \
    stonith-action=reboot \
    stonith-timeout=150

    resource-stickiness=1000 \
    migration-threshold=50
op_defaults op-options: \
    timeout=600 \
    record-pending=true
----

Now add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# crm configure load update crm-bs.txt
----

==== STONITH

As already explained in the requirements, STONITH is crucial for a supported cluster setup.
Without a valid fencing mechanism your cluster is unsupported.

A standard STONITH mechanism implements SBD based fencing. The SBD STONITH method is
very stable and reliable and has proved very good road capability.

You can use other fencing methods available for example from your public cloud provider.
However, it is crucial to intensively test the server fencing.

For SBD based fencing you can use one up to three SBD devices. The cluster will react differently
when an SBD device is lost. The differences and SBD fencing are explained very well in the {SUSE}
product documentation of the {sleha} available at {productdocu}.

You need to adapt the SBD resource for the {saphana} scale-out cluster.

As user {refsidadm} create a file named for crm-fencing.txt.

.Configure fencing
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# vi crm-fencing.txt

Enter the following to _crm-fencing.txt_:
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
primitive stonith-sbd stonith:external/sbd \

----

Now load the configuration from the file to the cluster.

==== Cluster in maintenance mode

Load the configuration for the resources and the constraints
step-by-step to the cluster to explain the different parts. The
best way to avoid unexpected cluster reactions is to 

* first set the complete cluster to maintenance mode, 
* then do all needed changes and,
* as last step, end the cluster maintenance mode.

----
# crm configure property maintenance-mode=true
----

==== SAPHanaTopology
Next, define the group of resources needed, before the {saphana} instances can be
started. Prepare the changes in a text file, for example _crm-saphanatop.txt_,
and load these with the _crm_ command.

If necessary, change the *SID* and *instance number* (bold) to appropriate
values for your setup.

.Configure SAPHanaTopology

|===
|Name
|Description

|PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER
|Defines whether RA should prefer to take over to the secondary instance instead
of restarting the failed primary locally. Set to *true* for SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut.

|AUTOMATED_REGISTER
|Defines whether a former primary should be automatically registered to be
secondary of the new primary. With this parameter you can adapt the level of
system replication automation.

If set to *false*, the former primary must be manually registered. The cluster
will not start this {SAPHANA} RDBMS until it is registered to avoid double
primary up situations.

|DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT
|Time difference needed between two primary time stamps if a dual-primary
situation occurs. If the time difference is less than the time gap, the
cluster holds one or both sites in a "WAITING" status.
This is to give an administrator the chance to react on a failover. If the complete node
of the former primary crashed, the former primary will be registered after the
time difference is passed. If "only" the {SAPHANA} RDBMS has crashed, then the
former primary will be registered immediately. After this registration to the
new primary, all data will be overwritten by the system replication.

Now check if the HA/DR provider could set the appropriate
cluster attribute hana_{refsidLC}_glob_srHook:

.Query the srHook cluster attribute
==========
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# crm_attribute -G  -n hana_{refsidLC}_glob_srHook
----

You should get an output similar to the following:

----
scope=crm_config  name=hana_{refsidLC}_glob_srHook value=SFAIL
----
==========

In this case the HA/DR provider sets the attribute to SFAIL to inform the
cluster about a broken system replication.

==== Using special virtual host names or FQHN during the installation of {saphana}

If you have used special virtual host names or the fully qualified host name
(FQHN) instead of the short node name, the resource agents need to map these
names. To be able to match the short node name with the used SAP 'virtual
host name', the {sapHostAgent} needs to report the list of installed instances
correctly:

== Testing the cluster

.<<Planning>> <<OsSetup>> <<SAPHanaInst>> <<SAPHanaHsr>> <<Integration>> <<Cluster>> Testing
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase7.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

[[Testing]]Testing is one of the most important project tasks for implementing
clusters. Proper testing is crucial. Make sure that all test cases derived from
project or customer expectations are defined and passed completely.
*Without testing the project is likely to fail in production use*.

The test prerequisite, if not described differently, is always that all cluster
nodes are booted, are already normal members of the cluster and the {saphana}
RDBMS is running. The system replication is in state *SYNC* represented by 'SOK'.
The cluster is idle, no actions are pending, no migration constraints left over,
no fail-counts left over.

In the current version of this setup guide a plain list of test cases is provided.
A more detailed description of the test cases is planned for future versions.
These details will be provided either in an updated version of this guide or the
test cases will be extracted to a separate test plan document.

=== Generic cluster tests

The cluster tests described in this section cover the cluster reaction during
operations. This includes starting and stopping the complete cluster or
simulating SBD failures and much more.

* Parallel start of all cluster nodes (`systemctl start pacemaker` should be done in a short time frame).
* Stop of the complete cluster.
* Isolate ONE of the two {saphana} sites.
* Power-off the majority maker.
* Isolate the SBD.
* Simulate a maintenance procedure with cluster continuously running.
* Simulate a maintenance procedure with cluster restart.
// * ? Force a sr_takeover via cluster migration commands (use force!!).
* Kill the corosync process of one of the cluster nodes.

=== Tests on the primary site

The tests described in this section are checking the reaction on several
failures of the primary site.

==== Tests regarding cluster nodes of the primary site

The tests listed here check the {saphana} and cluster reaction if one or more nodes of the primary site are failing or
re-joining the cluster.

* Power-off master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any standby node of the primary.
* Re-join of a previously power-off cluster node.

==== Tests regarding the complete primary site

This test category is simulating a complete site failure.

* Power-off all nodes of the primary site in parallel.

==== Tests regarding the {saphana} instances of the primary site

The tests listed here are checks about the {saphana} and cluster reactions triggered by application failures such as a crashed {saphana} instance.

* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the primary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the primary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any standby node.
* Kill sapstartsrv of any {saphana} instance of the primary.

=== Tests on the secondary site

The tests described in this section are checking the reaction on several failures of the secondary site.

==== Tests regarding cluster nodes of the secondary site

The tests listed here check the {saphana} and cluster reaction if one or more nodes of the secondary site are failing or
re-joining the cluster.

* Power-off master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Power-off any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Power-off any standby node of the secondary.
* Re-join of a previously power-off cluster node.

==== Tests regarding the complete secondary site

This test category is simulating a complete site failure.

* Power-off all nodes of the secondary site in parallel.

==== Tests regarding the {saphana} instances of the secondary site

The tests listed here are checks about the {saphana} and cluster reactions triggered by application failures such as a crashed {saphana} instance.

* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of the master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary. The test assumes that there is still an {saphana} standby instance.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any worker node but not the master name server of the secondary after all standby instances are already in use.
* Kill the {saphana} instance of any standby node.
* Kill _sapstartsrv_ of any {saphana} instance of the secondary.


== Administration

=== Dos and don'ts

In your project, you should *do* the following:

* Define (and test) STONITH *before* adding other resources to the cluster.
 
* Do *intensive* testing.

* *Tune* the timeouts of operations of SAPHanaController and SAPHanaTopology.

* Start with ** PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER=true**, **AUTOMATED_REGISTER=false** and
  **DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT=”7200”**.

* Always make sure that the cluster configuration does not contain any left-over
  client-prefer location constraints or fail-counts.

* Before testing or beginning maintenance procedures, check if the cluster is
  in idle state.

In your project, *avoid* the following:

* Rapidly changing/changing back cluster configuration, such as: Setting nodes
  to standby and online again or stopping/starting the multi-state resource.

* Creating a cluster without proper time synchronization or unstable name
  resolutions for hosts, users, and groups.

* Adding location rules for the clone, multi-state or IP resource. Only
  location rules mentioned in this setup guide are allowed.

* As "migrating" or "moving" resources in _crm-shell_, HAWK or other tools would
  add client-prefer location rules, these activities are completely *forbidden!*.

=== Monitoring and tools
You can use the High Availability Web Konsole (HAWK), {SAPHANA} Cockpit and
different command line tools for cluster status requests.

==== HAWK – cluster status and more
You can use an Internet browser to check the cluster status. Use the following URL:
https://<node>:7630

////
TODO PRIO3: Discuss some disadvantages of HAWK or missing features:
S_IDLE? cs_cluterstate or crm_simulate
cli-? crm configure | grep cli
failcount? -INF?
////

The login credentials are provided during the installation dialog of _ha-cluster-init_. Keep in mind to
change the default password of the Linux user _hacluster_ .

.Cluster Status in Hawk
image::hawk-sap-hana-scale-out-sle15.png[scaledwidth="95%"]

If you set up the cluster using _ha-cluster-init_ and you have installed all
packages as described above, your system will provide a very useful Web
interface. You can use this graphical Web interface to get an overview of the
complete cluster status, perform administrative tasks or even configure resources
and cluster bootstrap parameters.

Read the product manuals for a complete documentation of this powerful user
interface.

==== {SAPHANA} Cockpit
Database-specific administration and checks can be done with {SAPHANA} Cockpit.

.{SAPHANA} Cockpit – System Replication Overview
image::SAP-HANA-Cockpit-SR-Overview.png[scaledwidth="95%"]

NOTE: Be extremely careful with changing any parameter or the topology of the
system replication. This might cause an interference with the cluster resource management.

A positive example is to register a former primary as new secondary and you have
set _AUTOMATED_REGISTER=false_.

A negative example is to un-register a secondary,
disable the system replication on the primary, and similar actions.

For all actions that change the system replication it is recommended to first check
for the maintenance procedure.

==== Cluster command line tools

crm_mon::
A simple overview can be obtained by calling _crm_mon_. Using the option _-r_ shows
also stopped but already configured resources. Option _-1_ tells _crm_mon_ to
output the status once instead of periodically.

See manual page crm_mon(8) for details.

SAPHanaSR-showAttr::
To show some SAPHanaController and SAPHanaTopology resource agent
internal values, you can call the program _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_. The internal
values, storage location and their parameter names may change in the next versions.
The command _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ will always fetch the values from the correct
storage location. Find more details and examples in manual page
SAPHanaSR-showAttr(8).

[IMPORTANT]
Do *not* use cluster commands like _crm_attribute_ to fetch the values directly
from the cluster. Your methods will be broken, when you need to move an attribute
to a different storage location or even out of the cluster.
_SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ is firstly a test program only and should not be used for
automated system monitoring.

The tool displays all interesting cluster attributes in three areas.

* The **global** section shows information about {saphana} SID, cib time
  stamp and a fall-back for the status of the system replication.

* The **site** section shows the attributes per site. It shows the system
  replication status as reported by {saphana} HADR provider. Further it shows
  which site the primary and the return code of the _landscapeHostConfiguration.py_
  script. In addition the active master name server is shown.

* The **hosts** section shows the node status, the roles of the host inside the
  {saphana} database, the calculated score to get the primary master name server
  and the site the host belongs to.

==========

The majority maker _suse-mm_ does not run an {saphana} instance and therefore
neither has a role attribute nor a score or site value.

==== {SAPHANA} LandscapeHostConfiguration

To check the status of an {SAPHANA} database and to figure out if the cluster
should react, you can use the script `landscapeHostConfiguration.py`.

.Check the landscape status as user {refsidadm}

==========

Following the SAP HA guideline, the _SAPHana_ resource agent interprets the
return codes in the following way:

[cols="1,3", options="header"]
.Table Interpretation of Return Codes
|===
|Return Code
|Description

|4
|{SAPHANA} database is up and OK. The cluster does interpret this as correctly
running database.

|3
|{SAPHANA} database is up and in status INFO. The cluster does interpret this as
a correctly running database.

|2
|{SAPHANA} database is up and in status warning. The cluster does interpret this
as a correctly running database.

|1
|{SAPHANA} database is down. If the database should be up and is not own by
intention, this could trigger a takeover.

|0
|Internal Script Error – to be ignored.
