= {eic} on SUSE

== Introduction

This guide describes how to prepare your infrastructure for the installation of {eic} on {rke} using {rancher}.
It will guide you through the steps of:

* Installing {rancher}
* Setting up {rke} clusters
* Deploying mandatory components for {eic}
// * Deploying {eic} into your {rke}

NOTE: This guide does not contain information about sizing your landscapes. Visit 
https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite?locale=en-US and search for the "Edge Integration Cell Sizing Guide".

NOTE: In this guide we'll use $ and # for shell commands, where # means that the command needs to be executed as a root user and
$ that the command can be run by any user.

== Preparations

* Get subscriptions for:
** {slem} {slem_version}
** {rancher} {rancher_version}
** {lh} {lh_version}
** {sle_ha} *

+++*+++ Only needed if you want to setup {rancher} in a high available setup.

IMPORTANT: If you want to use different versions of {slem}, {rancher}, {rke} or {lh}, make sure to check the support matrix for the related solutions you want to use:
https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/


Furthermore:

* Check the storage requirements.

* Create a or get access to a private container registry.

* Get an SAP S-user ID to access software and documentation from SAP.

* Read the relevant SAP documentation:

** https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839[Release Note for SAP Edge Integration Cell]

** https://me.sap.com/notes/2946788[Release Note for SAP ELM Bridge]

== Landscape Overview

To run {eic} in a production ready and supported way, you'll need to setup multiple Kubernetes clusters and their nodes.
Those comprise a Kubernetes cluster where you'll install {rancher} to setup and manage the production and non-production clusters.
For this {rancher} cluster, we recommend using 3 Kubernetes nodes and a load balancer.

The {eic} will need to run in a dedicated Kubernetes cluster.
For a HA setup of this cluster, we recommend using 3 Kubernetes Control Plane and 3 Kubernetes Worker nodes.

To give you a graphical overview of what's needed, please take a look at the landscape overview:

* The dark blue rectangles represent Kubernetes clusters.
* The olive rectangles represent Kubernetes nodes that hold the roles of Control Plane and Worker combined.
* The green rectangles represent Kubernetes Control Plane nodes.
* The orange rectangles represent Kubernetes Worker nodes.

We'll use this graphical overview through the guide to visualize what's the next step and what it's for.

== Installing {slem} {slem_version}
There are several ways to install {slem} {slem_version}. For this best practice guide, we use the installation method via graphical installer. But in cloud-native deployments it is highly recommended to use Infrastructure as Code technologies to fully automate the deployment and lifecycle processes.

== Installing {metallb} and databases

In the following chapter we present an example for setting up {metallb}, {redis} and {pg}.

NOTE: Keep in mind that the descriptions and instructions below might differ from the deployment you need for your specific infrastructure and use cases.

=== Logging in to {rac}

{rancher} instances prior to version 2.9 cannot integrate the {rac}. Therefore, you need to use the console and Helm.
The easiest way to do so is to use the built-in shell in {rancher}. To access it, navigate to your cluster and click *Kubectl Shell* as shown below:

image::EIC-Rancher-Kubectl-Button.png[title=Rancher Shell Access,scaledwidth=99%]

A shell will open as shown in the image:

image::EIC-Rancher-Kubectl-Shell.png[title=Rancher Shell Overview,scaledwidth=99%]


You must log in to {rac}. This can be done as follows:

----
$ helm registry login dp.apps.rancher.io/charts -u <yourUser> -p <your-token>
----

=== Installing {metallb}

This chapter is intended to walk you through installing and configuring {metallb} on your Kubernetes cluster used for {eic}.

=== Installing {redis}

// https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/prepare-your-kubernetes-cluster#redis-data-store-requirements

Before deploying {redis}, esure that the requirements described at
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839 are met.

Also, make sure you understand what grade of persistence you want to achieve for your {redis} cluster.
For more information about persistence in {redis}, see
https://redis.io/docs/management/persistence/.

=== Installing {pg}

// https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/prepare-your-kubernetes-cluster#postgresql-database-requirements

Before deploying {pg}, ensure that the requirements described at
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839 are met.

== Installing {eic}

// include::SAP-EIC.adoc[]
At this point, you should be able to deploy {eic}.
Follow the instructions at https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/setting-up-and-managing-edge-integration-cell
to install {eic} in your prepared environments.

[#selfSignedCertificates]
=== Using self-signed certificates

In this chapter we will explain how to create self-signed certificates and how to make them available within Kubernetes.

==== Creating self-signed certificates

WARNING: We strongly advise against using self-signed certificates in production environments.

The first step is to create a certification authority (hereinafter referred to as CA) with a key and certificate.
The following excerpt provides an example of how to create one with a passphrase of your choice:
----
$ openssl req -x509 -sha256 -days 1825 -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout rootCA.key -out rootCA.crt -passout pass:<ca-passphrase> -subj "/C=DE/ST=BW/L=Nuremberg/O=SUSE"
----

This will give you the files `rootCA.key` and `rootCA.crt`.
The server certificate requires a certificate signing request (hereinafter referred to as CSR).
The following excerpt shows how to create such a CSR:
----
$ openssl req -newkey rsa:2048 -keyout domain.key -out domain.csr -passout pass:<csr-passphrase> -subj  "/C=DE/ST=BW/L=Nuremberg/O=SUSE"
----

Before you can sign the CSR, you need to add the DNS names of your Kuberntes Services to the CSR.
Therefore, create a file with the content below and replace the *<servicename>* and *<namespace>* with the name of your Kubernetes service and the namespace in which it is placed:
 
----
authorityKeyIdentifier=keyid,issuer
basicConstraints=CA:FALSE
subjectAltName = @alt_names
[alt_names]
DNS.1 = <servicename>.<namespace>.svc.cluster.local
DNS.2 = <AltService>.<AltNamespace>.svc.cluster.local
----

You can now use the previously created files _rootCA.key_ and _rootCA.crt_ with the extension file to sign the CSR.
The example below shows how to do that by passing the extension file (here called _domain.ext_):
----
$ openssl x509 -req -CA rootCA.crt -CAkey rootCA.key -in domain.csr -out server.pem -days 365 -CAcreateserial -extfile domain.ext -passin pass:<ca-passphrase>
----

This creates a file called _server.pem_ which is your certificate to be used for your application.


Your _domain.key_ is still encrypted at this point, but the application requires an unencrypted server key.
To decrypt, run the given command which will create the _server.key_.
----
$ openssl rsa -passin pass:<csr-passphrase> -in domain.key -out server.key
----

Some applications (like Redis) require a full certificate chain to operate.
To get a full certificate chain, link the generated file _server.pem_ with the file _rootCA.crt_ as follows:

----
$ cat server.pem rootCA.crt > chained.pem
----

You should then have the files _server.pem_, _server.key_ and _chained.pem_ that can be used for your applications such as Redis or PostgresSQL.


==== Uploading certificates to Kubernetes

To use certificate files in Kubernetes, you need to save them as so-called *Secrets*.
For an example of uploading your certificates to Kubernetes, see the following excerpt:
 
----
$ kubectl -n <namespace> create secret generic <certName> --from-file=./root.pem --from-file=./server.pem --from-file=./server.key
----

NOTE: Most applications are expecting to have the secret to be used in the same namespace as the application.
