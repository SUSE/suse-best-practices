=== Introduction

// TODO PRIO3: CostOpt15 - feedback BS - SAP allows multiple non-replicated systems on the secondary site - should we also allow this (SAP doku chapter 4.3)?
{sles4sapreg} is optimized in various ways for {SAPreg} applications.
This guide provides detailed information about installing and customizing
*{sles4sap} for {hana} system replication in the {usecase} scenario*.

.{usecase} scenario described in this setup guide
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-costOpt2.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]

For an overview of supported scenarios, see <<scenarios>>.

{SAPHANA} is the only database platform for prominent SAP platforms like
{S4HANA}. {SAP} NetWeaver can also use {SAPHANA} as database back-end.
As {SAPHANA} is only available on the Linux operating system, this triggers
lots of Unix-to-Linux and Windows-to-Linux migrations.

{SUSE} is accommodating this development by offering {sles4sap},
the recommended and supported operating system for {hana}. In close
collaboration with {SAP}, cloud service and hardware partners, {SUSE} provides two
resource agents for customers to ensure the high availability of {hana} system
replications.

==== Abstract

This guide describes planning, setup, and basic testing of {sles4sap} based on
the high availability solution scenario "{SAPHANA} Scale-Up System Replication Cost Optimized".

From the application perspective, the following variants are covered:

- plain system replication

// - system replication with secondary site read-enabled

// - multi-tier (chained) system replication

// - multi-target system replication

- multi-tenant database containers

From the infrastructure perspective, the following variants are covered:

- 2-node cluster with  disk-based SBD

- 3-node cluster with diskless SBD

- On-premises deployment on physical and virtual machines

- Public cloud deployment (usually needs additional documentation focusing on the cloud specific implementation details)

Deployment automation simplifies roll-out. There are several options available,
particularly on public cloud platfoms (for example https://www.suse.com/c/automating-the-sap-hana-high-availability-cluster-deployment-for-microsoft-azure/).
Ask your public cloud provider or your SUSE contact for details.

See <<cha.hana-sr.scenario>> for details.

==== Scale-up versus scale-out

// TODO PRIO2: add stonith resource to the graphic

The first set of scenarios includes the architecture and development of _scale-up_ solutions.

.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster
image::hana_sr_in_cluster.svg[scaledwidth=70.0%]

For these scenarios, {SUSE} has developed the scale-up
resource agent package `{SAPHanaSR}`. System replication helps to
replicate the database data from one computer to another computer to compensate for database failures (single-box replication).

//.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster
//image::hana_sr_in_cluster.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]

The second set of scenarios includes the architecture and development of
_scale-out_ solutions (multi-box replication). For these scenarios, {SUSE}
has developed the scale-out resource agent package `{SAPHanaSR}-ScaleOut`.

.{hana} System Replication Scale-Out in the Cluster
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Cluster.svg[scaledwidth=70.0%]

With this mode of operation, internal {hana} high availability (HA)
mechanisms and the resource agent must work together or be coordinated
with each other. {hana} system replication automation for scale-out
is described in a separate document available on our documentation Web page
at {reslibrary}. The document for scale-out is named _"{docScaleOut}"_.

==== Scale-up scenarios and resource agents

[[scenarios]]

{SUSE} has implemented the scale-up scenario with the `{SAPHanaRA}` resource
agent (RA), which performs the actual check of the {HANA} database
instances. This RA is configured as a multi-state resource. In the
scale-up scenario, the promoted RA instance assumes responsibility for the {hana}
databases running in primary mode. The non-promoted RA instance is responsible for
instances that are operated in synchronous (secondary) status.

To make configuring the cluster as simple as possible, SUSE has
developed the `{SAPHanaTopRA}` resource agent. This RA runs on all nodes
of a {sles4sap} cluster and gathers information about the
statuses and configurations of {hana} system replications. It is
designed as a normal (stateless) clone.

{hana} System replication for scale-up is supported in the following
scenarios or use cases:

* *Performance optimized* (_A => B_). This scenario and setup is described
in another document available from the documentation Web page ({reslibrary}).
The document for _performance optimized_ is named _"{docPerfOpt}"_.
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-perfOpt.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
In the performance optimized scenario an {hana} RDBMS site A is synchronizing
with an {HANA} RDBMS site B on a second node. As the {HANA} RDBMS on the second node
is configured to pre-load the tables, the takeover time is typically very
short.
+
One big advance of the performance optimized scenario of {hana} is the
possibility to allow read access on the secondary database site. To support
this *read enabled* scenario, a second virtual IP address is added to the cluster
and bound to the secondary role of the system replication.

* *Cost optimized* (_A => B, Q_). This scenario and setup *is described in this document.*
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - cost optimized
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-costOpt2.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
In the cost optimized scenario, the second node is also used for a
stand-alone non-replicated {hana} RDBMS system (like QAS or TST). Whenever a takeover
is needed, the non-replicated system must be stopped first. As the
productive secondary system on this node must be limited in using system
resources, the table preload must be switched off. A possible
takeover needs longer than in the performance optimized use case.
+
In the cost optimized scenario, the secondary needs to be running in a reduced
memory consumption configuration. This is why _read enabled_ must not be used in this
scenario.
+
As already explained, the secondary {HANA} database must run with memory resource
restrictions. The HA/DR provider needs to remove these memory restrictions when a
takeover occurs. This is why multi SID (also MCOS) must not be used in this scenario.

* *Multi Tier* (_A => B -> C_) and *Multi Target* (_B <= A => C_).
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized chain
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-Chain.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
A _Multi Tier_ system replication has an additional target. In the past, this third
side must have been connected to the secondary (chain topology). With current {saphana}
versions, the _multiple target topology_ is allowed by {sap}.
+
.{hana} System Replication Scale-Up in the Cluster - performance optimized multi-target
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-MultiTarget.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]
+
Multi-tier and multi-target systems are implemented as described in the document
for the _performance optimized_ scenario named _"{docPerfOpt}"_. Multi-tier and multi-target systems
are only supported in the _performance optimized_ scenario and _not with the cost optimized_ scenario.
They are mentioned here to give an overview of our entire portfolio of solutions.

In the multi-tier and multi-target scenario only the first replication pair
(A and B) is handled by the Linux cluster.

* *Multi-tenancy* or MDC.
+
Multi-tenancy is supported for all above scenarios and use cases. This scenario is supported since {hana} SPS09.
The setup and configuration from a cluster point of view is the same for multi-tenancy and single container.
Thus you can use the above documents for both kinds of scenarios.

// TODO PRIO2: Add new restrictions here (think about multi-target, handshake, ...)

==== The concept of the cost optimized scenario

{SAP} allows to run a non-replicated instance of {SAPHANA} on the system replication site on
the secondary site. Such a non-replicated database could be a development (DEV), test (TST), or
quality assurance system (QAS).

In case of a failure of the primary {SAPHANA} on the primary site the cluster first tries to restart
the failed {SAPHANA} database locally on this node. If the restart is not possible or if the complete
primary node crashed, the takeover process will be triggered.

In case of a takeover, the secondary (replica) of this {SAPHANA} on node 2 is promoted *after* the
shutdown of the non-replicated {SAPHANA}.

Alternatively you can configure a different resource handling procedure, but we recommend
to try to restart {SAPHANA} locally first, as a takeover with non-preloaded tables can
consume much time. Also, the needed graceful stop of the non-replicated system will take
additional time. Thus, in many environments, the local restart will be faster.

To achieve an automation of this resource handling process,  use the {SAPHANA}
resource agents included in SAPHanaSR. System replication of the productive database is done
using the resource agents `SAPHana` and `SAPHanaTopology`. The handling of the non-replicated database
is implemented using the `SAPInstance` resource agent.

While `SAPHana` and `SAPHanaTopology` are driving the automation of the {SAPHANA} system replication,
`SAPInstance` is used for the non-replicated {SAPHANA} database. In the past the architecture used
`SAPDatabase` instead. The move to `SAPInstance` was needed to get rid of the error-prone
user secure store keys setup procedure. Find more details in the blog article
"SAP HANA Cost-optimized – An alternative Route is available" at https://suse.com/c/sap-hana-cost-optimized-an-alternative-route-is-available/.

The automated shutdown of the non-replicated {SAPHANA} database (for example QAS) is achieved by cluster
rules. More precisely, it is an anti-colocation of {SAPHANA} promoted versus {SAPHANA} non-replicated. This means
if the primary {SAPHANA} system (like HA1) fails, the anti-colocation rules for the {SAPHANA} non-replicated system (like QAS) are triggered
and the `SAPInstance` resource agent shuts down the non-replicated {SAPHANA} database.

The takeover to the secondary site takes up a lot of time, because the non-replicated database needs to
be stopped gracefully prior to take over the productive database. This extended takeover time
is the main disadvantage of the cost optimized scenario. Thus the cost optimized scenario might be combined
with persistent memory to benefit from SAP HANA’s persistent memory features.

NOTE: If you want to achieve a very fast takeover, the performance optimized scenario is the better option.

In addition to the description of the concept in this best practice document, read the corresponding
{SAP} documentation such as "Using Secondary Servers for Non-Productive systems". The
section is available for example for {HANA} 2.0 SPS05 at https://help.sap.com/viewer/6b94445c94ae495c83a19646e7c3fd56/2.0.05/en-US/5447545b91a04cf8a0d6133a026f2be5.html.

The cluster *only allows a takeover* to the secondary site if the {hana}
system replication *was in sync* until the point when the service of the primary
got lost. This ensures that the last commits processed on the primary site are
already available at the secondary site.

{sap} did improve the interfaces between {saphana} and external software, such as
cluster frameworks. These improvements also include the implementation of {saphana}
call outs in case of special events, such as status changes for services or system replication
channels. These call outs are also called HA/DR providers. These interfaces can be used by
implementing {saphana} hooks written in python. {suse} has enhanced the SAPHanaSR package
to include such {saphana} hooks to optimize the cluster interface. Using the
{saphana} hooks described in this document allows to inform the cluster immediately
if the {saphana} system replication is broken. In addition to the {saphana} hook status,
the cluster continues to poll the system replication status on a regular basis.

You can adjust the level of automation by setting the parameter `AUTOMATED_REGISTER`.
If automated registration is activated, the cluster will automatically register
a former failed primary to become the new secondary. Refer to the man pages SAPHanaSR(7) and ocf_suse_SAPHana(7) for details on all supported parameters and features.

IMPORTANT: The solution is not designed to manually 'move' the primary or
secondary instance using HAWK or any other cluster client commands. In
_<<cha.hana-sr.administrate>>_ of this document, we describe how to 'migrate' the primary to the secondary site
using {sap} and cluster commands.

[[cha.hana-sr.scenario]]
== Supported scenarios and prerequisites

With the `SAPHanaSR` resource agent software package, we limit the support to
scale-up (single-box to single-box) system replication with the following
configurations and parameters:

* Two-node clusters are standard. Three node clusters are fine if you install
the resource agents also on that third node. But define in the cluster that
{saphana} resources must never run on that third node. In this case the third
node is an additional majority maker in case of cluster separation.
* The cluster must include a valid STONITH method.
** Any STONITH mechanism supported for production use by {sleha} {prodnr} (like
SBD, IPMI) is supported with SAPHanaSR.
** This guide is focusing on the SBD fencing method as this is hardware independent.
** If you use disk-based SBD as the fencing mechanism, you need one or more shared
drives. For productive environments, we recommend more than one SBD device. For
details on disk-based SBD, read the product documentation for {sleha} and the
manual pages sbd(8) and stonith_sbd(7).
** For diskless SBD, you need at least three cluster nodes. The diskless SBD
mechanism has the benefit that you do not need a shared drive for fencing.
Since diskless SBD is based on self-fencing, reliable detection of lost quorum
is absolutely crucial.
** Priority fencing is an optional improvement for two nodes, but does not work
for three nodes.
* Both nodes are in the same network segment (layer 2). Similar methods provided
by cloud environments such as overlay IP addresses and load balancer functionality
are also fine. Follow the cloud specific guides to set up your {sles4sap} cluster.
* Technical users and groups, such as _{refsidadm}_ are defined
locally in the Linux system. If that is not possible, additional measures are needed to ensure reliable
resolution of users, groups and permissions at any time. This might include caching.
* Name resolution of the cluster nodes and the virtual IP address must be done
locally on all cluster nodes. If that is not possible, additional measures are
needed to ensure reliable resolution of host names at any time.
* Time synchronization between the cluster nodes, such as NTP, is required.
* Both {hana} instances of the system replication pair (primary and secondary)
have the same SAP Identifier (SID) and instance number.
* If the cluster nodes are installed in different data centers or data center
areas, the environment must match the requirements of the {sleha} cluster product.
Of particular concern are the network latency and recommended maximum distance
between the nodes. Review the product documentation for {sleha} about those
recommendations.
* Automated registration of a failed primary after takeover prerequisites need
to be defined.
** As initial configuration for projects, we recommend to switch off the automated
registration of a failed primary. The setup `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="false"` is set as
default. In this case, you need to register a failed primary after a takeover
manually. For re-registration, use precisely the site names that are already known
by the cluster. Use {sap} tools like {saphana} cockpit or _hdbnsutil_.
** For optimal automation, we recommend to set `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`.
** The cluster automates one single takeover in case of a failed primary. After
that happened, the initial state needs to be restored by the administrative
procedure outlined in this guide.
* Automated start of {hana} instances during system boot must be switched off.
* Multi-tenancy (MDC) databases are supported.
** Multi-tenancy databases can be used in combination with any other setup
(performance-optimized, cost-optimized and multi-tier).
** In MDC configurations, the {SAPHANA} RDBMS is treated as a single system including
all database containers. Therefore cluster takeover decisions are based on the
complete RDBMS status independent of the status of individual database containers.
** Tests on Multi-tenancy databases can force a different test procedure if you
are using strong separation of the tenants.
As an example, killing the complete {hana} instance using _HDB kill_ does not work,
because the tenants are running with different Linux user UIDs.
_{refsidadm}_ is not allowed to terminate the processes of the other tenant users.
** The scenario Multi-SID (MCOS) is not supported together with the cost optimized
scenario. Hence, only one replicating database pair and one non-replicating database
in the same cluster as described in this guide are supported for the cost-optimized
scenario.

The {sles4sap} versions are:

* You need at least {SAPHanaSR} version {sapHanaSrMinVers} and at least {sles4sap}
15 SP2.
* Intel Optane DCPMM (aka PMEM) is supported since {sles4sap} {prodNr} GA or newer.
* IBM Power vPMEM is supported since {sles4sap} {prodNr} SP1 or newer.

////
* {hana} versions:
// TODO PRIO3: remove HANA 1.0
** {hana} 1.0 is supported since SPS09 (095) for all mentioned setups. {hana} 1.0
does not support the HA/DR provider hook method srConnectionChanged() with
multi-target aware parameters. These parameters are needed for the HA/DR provider
hook in the package.
** For {hana} 1.0 you need version SPS10 rev3, SPS11 or newer if you want to stop
tenants during production and you want the cluster to be able to take over. Older
{hana} versions are marking the system replication as failed if you stop a tenant.
////

For the HA/DR provider hook scripts SAPHanaSR.py and susCostOpt.py, the following
requirements apply:

* {saphana} 2.0 SPS04 or later provides the HA/DR provider hook method
srConnectionChanegd() with multi-target aware parameters. {sap} HANA 1.0 does not
provide them. The multi-target aware parameters are needed for the SAPHanaSR
scale-up package.
* {saphana} 2.0 SPS04 or later provides the HA/DR provider hook method postTakeover().
// TODO PRIO1: check above version
* The user _{refsidadm}_ needs execution permission as user root for the command
crm_attribute.

Additional considerations for the {saphana} version are:

* Particularly the {HANA} system replication cost-optimized scenario can benefit
from {HANA}'s persistent memory features. Local restart and takeover are affected
by the time {HANA} needs for shutdown and loading column store. {HANA} 2.0 SPS04 and
later support persistent memory.

IMPORTANT: Without a valid STONITH method, the complete cluster is unsupported
and will not work properly.

If you need to implement a different scenario, we strongly recommend to define
a Proof of Concept (PoC) with {suse}. This PoC will focus on testing the existing
solution in your scenario. Most of the above mentioned limitations are set
because careful testing is needed.

In addition to {hana}, you need to install the {SAP} Host Agent on your system.

For information on supported hardware and virtualization, refer to the {SUSE}
release notes and hardware compatibility database:

* https://www.suse.com/releasenotes/
* https://www.suse.com/yessearch/

Also, take a look at the {HANA} product availability matrix, which can for example be found at
 https://support.sap.com/en/release-upgrade-maintenance.html#section_1969201630.

Additional information for deploying the {usecase} scenario in particular public
clouds is available either from the respective cloud provider or from {SUSE} at
 {reslibrary}.

[[cha.hana-sr.scope]]
== Scope of this document

This document describes how to set up the cluster to control {hana} in
System Replication scenarios. The document focuses on the steps to integrate
an already installed and working {hana} with System Replication.
In this document {sles4sap} {prodNr} {prodSP} is used. This concept can also be
used with {sles4sap} {prodNr} SP2 or newer.

The described example setup builds an {hana} HA cluster in two data centers in
{saplocation1} ({sapsite1}) and in {saplocation2} ({sapsite2}), installed on two
{sles4sapa} {prodnr} {prodsp} systems. In addition, a non-replicated {SAPHANA}
is installed and added to the cluster control.

.Cluster with {hana} SR - cost optimized
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUP-costOpt2.svg[scaledwidth=100.0%]

You can either set up the cluster using the YaST wizard, doing it manually or
using your own automation.

If you prefer to use the YaST wizard, you can use the shortcut _yast sap_ha_ to
start the module. The procedure to set up {saphanasr} using YaST is described in
the product documentation of {sles4sap} in section _Setting Up an SAP HANA Cluster_
at {sles4sapGuide15}cha-cluster.html.

This guide focuses on the manual setup of the cluster to explain the details and
to give you the possibility to create your own automation.

The seven main setup steps are:

Planning the installation is essential for a successful {saphana} cluster setup.

Before you start, you need the following:

- Software from {suse}: {sles4sap} installation media, a valid subscription, and
access to update channels
- Software from {sap}: {saphana} installation media
- Physical or virtual systems including disks
- Filled parameter sheet (see below <<parameter-sheet>>)


=== Minimum lab requirements and prerequisites

NOTE: The minimum lab requirements mentioned here are by no means SAP sizing
information. These data are provided only to rebuild the described cluster in a
lab for test purposes. The following minimum setup uses the half-size of RAM
for the secondary {saphana} database which has table preload inactive.
Even for tests the requirements can increase, depending on your test scenario.
For productive systems ask your hardware vendor or use the official SAP sizing
tools and services. 

NOTE: Refer to {saphana} TDI documentation for allowed storage
configuration and file systems.

Requirements with 1 SAP system replication instance per site (1 : 1) - without
a majority maker (2 node cluster):

- 1 VM with 32GB RAM, 50 GB disk space for the system
- 1 VM with 48GB RAM, 50 GB disk space for the system
- 1 shared disk for SBD with 10 MB disk space
- 2 data disks (one per site) with a capacity of each 96 GB for {saphana}
- 1 data disk (for the non-replicated database) with a capacity of 96 GB for {saphana}
- 1 additional IP address for takeover
- 1 additional IP address for non-replicated database
- 1 optional IP address for HAWK Administration GUI

Requirements with 1 SAP system replication instance per site (1 : 1) - with a
majority maker (3 node cluster):

- 1 VM with 32 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space for the system
- 1 VM with 48 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space for the system
- 1 VM with 2 GB RAM, 50 GB disk space for the system
- 2 data disks (one per site) with a capacity of each 96 GB for {saphana}
- 1 data disk (for the non-replicated database) with a capacity of 96 GB for {saphana}
- 1 additional IP address for takeover
- 1 additional IP address for non-replicated database
- 1 optional IP address for HAWK Administration GUI

// Cost optimized: secondary in non-preload calculated with 50% memory consumption
// Disk pools size is calculated like:
//     shared = 1 * MEM
//     data   = NODES * 1   * MEM
//     log    =  NODES * 1/2 * MEM
//     pool = shared + data + log

=== Parameter sheet

[[parameter-sheet]]
Even if the setup of the cluster organizing two {saphana} sites is quite simple,
the installation should be planned properly. You should have all needed parameters
like SID, IP addresses and much more in place. It is good practice to first fill
out the parameter sheet and then begin with the installation.

This section contains information you should consider during the installation of
the operating system.

For the scope of this document, first {sles4sap} is installed and configured.
Then the {saphana} database including the system replication is set up. Finally
the automation with the cluster is set up and configured.

=== Installing {sles4sap}

Multiple installation guides already exist, for different purposes and with
different reasons to set up the server in a certain way. Below it is outlined
where this information can be found. In addition, you will find important details
you should consider to get a well-working system in place.

==== Installing the base operating system

Depending on your infrastructure and the hardware used, you need to adapt the
installation. All supported installation methods and minimum requirement are
described in the _Deployment Guide_ for {SLES} ({deploymentGuide15}).
In case of automated installations you can find further information in the
_AutoYaST Guide_ ({autoYastGuide15}). The main installation guides for {sles4sap}
that fit all requirements for {sapHana} are available from the SAP notes:

// SUSE and SAP are kept literal here not by the reference, because its a quote of an external title
* {sapnote15} SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15: Installation Note
* {sapnoteset15} SAP HANA DB: Recommended OS settings for SLES 15 / SLES for SAP Applications 15

// TODO PRIO2: refer to saptune

==== Installing additional software
With {sles4sap}, {SUSE} delivers special resource agents for {sapHana}. With the
pattern _sap-hana_, the resource agent for {sapHana} *scale-up* is installed. For
the *scale-out* scenario you need a special resource agent. Follow the instructions
below on each node if you have installed the systems based on SAP note {sapnote15}.
The pattern _High Availability_ summarizes all tools recommended to be installed on
*all* nodes, including the _majority maker_.

.Installing additional software for the HA cluster

====

Optionally, the packages supportutils-plugin-ha-sap and ClusterTools2 can be
installed. The first helps collecting data for support requests, the second
simplifies common administrative tasks.

For more information, see section _Installation and Basic Setup_ of the {uarr}
{sleha} guide.

Even though this document focuses on the integration of an installed {hana} with
system replication already set up into the Linux cluster, this chapter summarizes
the test environment. Always use the official documentation from {sap} to install
{hana} and to set up the system replication.

.Procedure

. Install the replicating {hana} databases.

. Check if the SAP hostagent is installed on all cluster nodes.
If this SAP service is not installed, install it now.

. Verify that both replicating databases are up and running.

. Install the non-replicating {hana} database on the secondary node.

. Verify that the non-replicating database is up and running.

=== Install the replicating {hana} databases

* Read the SAP Installation and Setup Manuals available at the SAP Marketplace.

* Download the {hana} Software from SAP Marketplace.

* Install the {hana} database as described in the {hana} Server Installation Guide.
The {hana} database client will be installed together with the server by default.

// TODO PRIO1: publish the below, once SAP ships systemd integration for HANA
// begin systemd style

=== Check if the SAP hostagent is installed on all cluster nodes

Check if the native `systemd`-enabled SAP hostagent and instance `sapstartsrv`
are installed on all cluster nodes. If not, install and enable them now.

As Linux user _root_, use the command `systemctl` and `systemd-cgls` to check
the SAP hostagent and instance services:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# systemctl list-unit-files | grep sap
saphostagent.service enabled
sapinit.service generated
saprouter.service disabled
saptune.service enabled
----
The mandatory `saphostagent` service is enabled. This is the installation default.
Some more {sap} related services might be enabled, e.g. the recommended `saptune`.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# systemctl list-unit-files | grep SAP
SAP{sapsid}_{sapino}.service enabled
----
The instance service is indeed enabled, as required. One instance service shows
up on the primary node. It looks similar on the secondary node, as long as the
additional non-replicating database is not installed.

=== Verify that both databases are up and running

For more information read the section _Setting Up System Replication_ of the
{hana} Administration Guide.

**Procedure**

. Back up the primary database.
. Enable primary database.
. Register, limit and start the secondary database.
. Verify the system replication.

=== Backing up the primary database

Back up the primary database as described in the {hana} Administration Guide,
section _{hana} Database Backup and Recovery_. We provide an example with SQL
commands. You need to adapt these backup commands to match your backup infrastructure.

.Simple backup for the system database and all tenants with one single backup call
=========================
As user _{refsidadm}_ enter the following command:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
~> hdbsql -u SYSTEM -d SYSTEMDB -i {sapino} \
   "BACKUP DATA FOR FULL SYSTEM USING FILE ('backup')"
----

You will get a command output similar to the following:

----
0 rows affected (overall time 7255.049 msec; server time 7253.369 msec)
----
=========================

.Simple backup for a single container (non MDC) database
=========================
Enter the following command as user _{refsidadm}_:

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> hdbsql -i {refInst} -u <dbuser> \
   "BACKUP DATA USING FILE ('backup')"
----
=========================

IMPORTANT: Without a valid backup, you can not bring {hana} into a system
replication configuration.

=== Enabling the primary node

As Linux user _{refsidadm}_, enable the system replication at the primary node. You
need to define a site name (like {sapsite1}). This site name must be unique for
all {hana} databases which are connected via system replication. This means the
secondary must have a different site name. The site names must not be changed
later when the cluster has been activated.

NOTE: Do not use strings like "primary" and "secondary" as site names.

.Enable the Primary
==========
Enable the primary using the `-sr_enable` option.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
// ----
// {sapnode1}:~> hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name={sapsite1}
// checking local nameserver:
// checking for active nameserver ...
// nameserver is running, proceeding ...
// configuring ini files ...
// successfully enabled system as primary site ...
// done.
// ----
----
{sapssid}adm@{sapnode1}:/usr/sap/{sapsid}/HDB{sapino}> hdbnsutil -sr_enable --name={sapsite1}
nameserver is active, proceeding ...
successfully enabled system as system replication source site
done.
----
==========

.Check SR Configuration on the Primary
==========
// the command output is still valid as of HANA 2.0 SPS5
Check the primary using the command `hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration`.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapssid}adm@{sapnode1}:/usr/sap/{sapsid}/HDB{sapino}> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration --sapcontrol=1
SAPCONTROL-OK: <begin>
mode=primary
site id=1
site name={sapsite1}
SAPCONTROL-OK: <end>
done.
----
==========

The mode has changed from “none” to “primary”. The site now has a site name and a site ID.

=== Registering the secondary node

The {hana} database instance on the secondary side must be stopped
before the instance can be registered for the system replication. You
can use your preferred method to stop the instance (like `HDB` or
`sapcontrol`). After the database instance has been stopped
successfully, you can register the instance using `hdbnsutil`. Again,
use the Linux user _{refsidadm}_:

.Stop the Secondary
==========
To stop the secondary, you can use the command line tool _HDB_.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapssid}adm@{sapnode2}:/usr/sap/{sapsid}/HDB{sapino}> HDB stop
----
==========

.Copy the KEY and KEY-DATA file from the primary to the secondary site
==========
Beginning with {hana} 2.0, the system replication is running encrypted.
The key files need to be copied-over from the primary to the secondary site.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> cd /usr/sap/{refSID}/SYS/global/security/rsecssfs
~> rsync -va {<node1-site A>:,}$PWD/data/SSFS_{refSID}.DAT
~> rsync -va {<node1-site A>:,}$PWD/key/SSFS_{refSID}.KEY
----
==========

.Register the Secondary
==========
The registration of the secondary is triggered by calling _hdbnsutil -sr_register ..._.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
...
{sapssid}adm@{sapnode2}:/usr/sap/{sapsid}/HDB{sapino}> hdbnsutil -sr_register --name={sapsite2} \
     --remoteHost={sapnode1} --remoteInstance={sapino} \
     --replicationMode=sync --operationMode=logreplay
adding site ...
nameserver {sapnode2}:30001 not responding.
collecting information ...
updating local ini files ...
done.
----
==========

The _remoteHost_ is the primary node in our case, the _remoteInstance_ is the
database instance number (here {sapino}).

Now start the database instance again and verify the system replication status.
On the secondary node, the mode should be one of "SYNC" or "SYNCMEM". "ASYNC" is
*not supported with automated cluster takeover*. The mode depends on the
*replicationMode* option defined during the registration of the secondary.

.Set Memory Limits for the {HANA} Secondary
==========
Add the memory limits to the global.ini. Keep in mind that SUSE cannot provide a
sizing guide here. {HANA} sizing needs to be done according to respective SAP
guidelines.
// TODO PRIO2: Add sizing reference here
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
[memorymanager]
global_allocation_limit = <size_in_mb_for_secondary_hana>
----
==========

.Switch table pre-load to off
==========
To allow the {HANA} secondary with less memory, you need to switch-off table pre-load.
[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
[system_replication]
preload_column_tables = false
----
==========

.Start Secondary and Check SR Configuration
==========
To start the new secondary, use the command line tool _HDB_. Then check the
SR configuration using `hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration`.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapssid}adm@{sapnode2}:/usr/sap/{sapsid}/HDB{sapino}> HDB start
...
{sapssid}adm@{sapnode2}:/usr/sap/{sapsid}/HDB{sapino}> hdbnsutil -sr_stateConfiguration \
     --sapcontrol=1
SAPCONTROL-OK: <begin>
mode=sync
site id=2
site name={sapsite2}
active primary site=1
primary masters={sapnode1}
SAPCONTROL-OK: <end>
done.
----
==========

To view the replication state of the whole {hana} cluster, use the
following command as _{refsidadm}_ user on the primary node:

.Checking System Replication Status Details
==========
The python script _systemReplicationStatus.py_ provides details about the current
system replication.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapssid}adm@{sapnode1}:/usr/sap/{sapsid}/HDB{sapino}> HDBSettings.sh systemReplicationStatus.py \
     --sapcontrol=1

site/2/REPLICATION_STATUS=ACTIVE
overall_replication_status=ACTIVE
site/1/REPLICATION_MODE=PRIMARY
site/1/SITE_NAME={sapsite1}
local_site_id=1
...
----
==========

=== Manually testing the {HANA} SR takeover

Before you integrate your {HANA} system replication into the HA cluster, it is
mandatory to do a manual takeover. Testing without the cluster helps to make
sure that basic operation (takeover and registration) is working as expected.

* Stop {hana} on node 1

* Takeover {hana} to node 2

* Register node 1 as secondary

* Start {hana} on node 1

* Wait until sync state is active

=== Optional: Manually re-establishing SAP HANA SR to original state

Bring the systems back to the original state:

* Stop {hana} on node 2

* Take over {hana} to node 1

* Register node 2 as secondary

* Start {hana} on node2

* Wait until sync state is active

[[cha.s4s.hana-hook]]
== {stepHook}

image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase5.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

This step is mandatory to inform the cluster immediately if the secondary gets
out of sync. The hook is called by {SAPHANA} using the HA/DR provider interface
in point-of-time when the secondary gets out of sync. This is typically the case
when the first commit pending is released. The hook is called by {SAPHANA} again
when the system replication is back. This HA/DR provider method is srConnectionChanged(),
the related {SUSE} hook script is SAPHanaSR.py.

Another hook is called by {SAPHANA} after an SR takeover has happened. This method can
be used to remove the {SAPHANA} memory limit and enable table preload. 
This HA/DR provider method is `postTakeover()`, the related {SUSE} hook script is 
`susCostOpt.py`.

**Procedure**

. Implement the python hook script SAPHanaSR.py on both sites.
. Implement the python hook script susCostOpt.py on fail-over site.
. Configure the system replication operation mode.
. Allow {refsidadm} to access the cluster on both sites.
. Create a database user key in {refsidadm}´s keystore on fail-over site.
. Test the hook integration.

// TODO PRIO2: Steps "Start" and "Test" are incomplete

This will implement two {hana} HA/DR provider hook scripts. SAPHanaSR.py needs
no config parameters. 
The configuration for susCostOpt.py needs to be adapted
according to your specific system size and user keystore. 
{SAPHANA} must be stopped to change the global.ini and allow {SAPHANA} to integrate
the HA/DR hook scripts during start.

=== Implementing SAPHanaSR hook for srConnectionChanged

Use the hook from the SAPHanaSR package /usr/share/SAPHanaSR/SAPHanaSR.py.
The hook must be configured on all {SAPHANA} cluster nodes.
In global.ini, the section `[ha_dr_provider_saphanasr]` needs to be created.
The section `[trace]` might be adapted.
Refer to the man page SAPHanaSR.py(7) for details on this HA/DR provider hook
script.

.Stop {hana}
==========
Stop {SAPHANA} either with _HDB_ or using _sapcontrol_.

[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> sapcontrol -nr {refInst} -function StopSystem
----
==========

[ha_dr_provider_saphanasr]
provider = SAPHanaSR
path = /usr/share/SAPHanaSR/

[trace]
ha_dr_saphanasr = info
----
==========


=== Implementing susCostOpt hook for postTakeover

Use the hook from the SAPHanaSR package /usr/share/SAPHanaSR/susCostOpt.py.
The hook must be configured on the takeover node where usually the {SAPHANA}
non-replicated database and the system replication secondary database is
running.
In global.ini, the section `[ha_dr_provider_suscostopt]` needs to be created.
The sections `[memorymanager]`, `[system_replication]` and optionally `[trace]`
need be adapted.
Refer to the man page susCostOpt.py(7) for details on this HA/DR provider hook
script.

=== Configuring system replication operation mode

When your system is connected as an SAP HANA SR target, you can find an entry in the _global.ini_
which defines the operation mode. Up to now there are the following modes available:

* _delta_datashipping_
* _logreplay_
* (_logreplay_readaccess_, not suitable for the cost optimized scenario)

Until a takeover and re-registration in the opposite direction, the entry for the
operation mode is missing on your primary site. The first operation mode which was
available was _delta_datashipping_. Today the preferred modes for HA are _logreplay_
or _logreplay_readaccess_. Using the operation mode _logreplay_ makes your secondary
site in the {saphana} system replication a hot standby system.
For more details regarding all operation modes, check the available SAP documentation
such as "How To Perform System Replication for SAP HANA ".

.Checking the Operation Mode
==========
Check both _global.ini_ files and add the operation mode if needed. Check the section
´system_replication´ for entry ´operation_mode = logreplay´.

Path for the _global.ini_: /hana/shared/<SID>/global/hdb/custom/config/
----
[system_replication]
operation_mode = logreplay
----
==========

=== Allowing {refsidadm} to access the cluster

The current version of the SAPHanaSR python hook uses the command `sudo` to allow
the _{refsidadm}_ user to access the cluster attributes.

//In Linux you can use `visudo`
//to start the vi editor for the _/etc/sudoers_ configuration file.

The user _{refsidadm}_ must be able to set the cluster attributes
hana_{refsidLC}_site_srHook_*. The {SAPHANA} system replication hook needs
password free access. The following example limits the sudo access to exactly
setting the needed attribute.

Replace the {refsidLC} by the *lowercase* SAP system ID (like `{sapssid}`).

The entries can be added to a new file _/etc/sudoers.d/SAPHanaSR_ so that the
original _/etc/sudoers_ file does not need to be edited.

.Entry in sudo permissions /etc/sudoers.d/SAPHanaSR file
==========
Basic sudoers entry to allow {refsidadm} to use the hook SAPHanaSR.

// command to be allowed used in the hook:
// "sudo /usr/sbin/crm_attribute -n hana_%s_site_srHook_%s -v %s -t crm_config -s SAPHanaSR"

----

More specific sudoers entries to meet a high security level.

All Cmnd_Alias entries must be each defined as a single line entry.
In our example, we have four separate lines with Cmnd_Alias entries and one line
for the _{refsidadm}_ user permitting the Cmnd_Aliases. In the document at
hand, however, the separate lines of the example might include a line-break
forced by document formatting.

=== Create a database user key in {refsidadm}´s keystore

The user keystore has to be created for the {refsidadm} of the replicating database.
The keystore has to be created on node 2, where the replication secondary database
is running.
In this example we use the {HANA} database user _SYSTEM_ for changing the values
for memory limit and column pre-load.

// TODO PRIO2: example to create restricted database user with minimum permissions
// TODO PRIO1: explain values in below example
// TODO PRIO1: use variables in below example

.Creating a database user key
==========
The example port and password need to be adapted.

# su - {refsidadm}
~> hdbuserstore SET sus_{refsid}_costopt localhost:31013 SYSTEM {mySapPwd}
~> hdbuserstore LIST sus_{refsid}_costopt
----
==========

IMPORTANT: For security reasons on production systems always a dedicated database
user with restricted permission needs to be created. The database user SYSTEM must
never be used.

Please refer to {SAPHANA} documentation for further information on database
users, permissions and the user keystore.


=== Start {hana} and  test the hook integration

After implementing the hooks on both nodes, you should start the productive
replicating {HANA} database on both nodes and check if the hook scripts have
been loaded.

Start {HANA} on both nodes. As user {refsidadm} either use _HDB_ or _sapcontrol_.
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
~> sapcontrol -nr {refInst} -function StartSystem
----

On both nodes you should check for the SAPHanaSR hook script. Perform the following
commands as user {refsidadm}:
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
{refsidadm}@{sapnode2}:/usr/sap/{refsid}/HDB{refInst}> cdtrace
{refsidadm}@{sapnode2}:/usr/sap/{refsid}/HDB{refInst}> grep HADR.*load.*SAPHanaS nameserver_*.3*.trc
----

On both nodes you might perform the following commands as user root:
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
# grep "sudo.*crm_attribute.*srHook" /var/log/messages
----

On node 2 you should check for the susCostOpt hook script. Perform the following
commands as user {refsidadm}:
[subs="specialchars,attributes"]
----
{refsidadm}@{sapnode2}:/usr/sap/{refsid}/HDB{refInst}> cdtrace
{refsidadm}@{sapnode2}:/usr/sap/{refsid}/HDB{refInst}> grep HADR.*load.*susCostOpt nameserver_*.trc
{refsidadm}@{sapnode2}:/usr/sap/{refsid}/HDB{refInst}> grep susCostOpt.init nameserver_*.3*.trc

image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleOut-Plan-Phase6.svg[scaledwidth="100%"]

This chapter describes the configuration of the cluster software {sleha}, which
is part of {sles4sap}, and the {hana} Database integration.

.Actions
. Basic cluster configuration

. Configuration of cluster properties and resources

. Testing the HA/DR provider hook integration

// TODO PRIO2: Describe the hook test (for example restart secondary) to trigger the write of cluster attributes

=== Configuring the basic cluster

The first step is to set up the basic cluster framework. For convenience, use YaST
or the {slehainit} script. It is strongly recommended to add a second corosync ring,
change it to UCAST communication and adjust the timeout values to fit your environment.

==== Setting up watchdog for "Storage-Based Fencing"

// TODO PRIO2: Should we add some more information here?

If you use the storage-based fencing (SBD) mechanism (diskless or disk-based),
you must also configure a watchdog. The watchdog is needed to reset a node if
the system cannot longer access the SBD (diskless or disk-based).
It is mandatory to configure the Linux system for loading a watchdog driver.
It is strongly recommended to use a watchdog with hardware assistance (as is
available on most modern systems), such as hpwdt, iTCO_wdt, or others. As fallback,
you can use the softdog module.

.Set-up for Watchdog
====
IMPORTANT: Access to the watchdog timer:
No other software must access the watchdog timer; it can only be accessed by one
process at any time. Some hardware vendors ship systems management software that
use the watchdog for system resets (for example HP ASR daemon). Such software must
be disabled if the watchdog is to be used by SBD.

Determine the right watchdog module. Alternatively, you can find a list of installed
drivers with your kernel version.

----
# ls -l /lib/modules/$(uname -r)/kernel/drivers/watchdog
----

Check if any watchdog module is already loaded.

----
# lsmod | egrep "(wd|dog|i6|iT|ibm)"
----

If you get a result, the system has already a loaded watchdog. If the watchdog
does not match your watchdog device, you need to unload the module.

To safely unload the module, check first if an application is using the watchdog device.

----
# lsof /dev/watchdog
# rmmod <wrong_module>
----

Enable your watchdog module and make it persistent. For the example below, _softdog_
has been used. However, _softdog_ has some restrictions and should not be used as
first option.

----
# echo softdog > /etc/modules-load.d/watchdog.conf
# systemctl restart systemd-modules-load
----

Check if the watchdog module is loaded correctly.

----
# lsmod | grep dog
# ls -l /dev/watchdog
----

Testing the watchdog can be done with a simple action. Ensure to switch of your {sapHana}
first because the watchdog will force an unclean reset or shutdown of your system.

In case a hardware watchdog is used, a desired action is predefined after the timeout of the watchdog has
reached. If your watchdog module is loaded and not controlled by any other application, do the following:

// TODO PRIO2: It seems a command is missing here??

IMPORTANT: Triggering the watchdog without continuously updating the watchdog
resets/switches off the system. This is the intended mechanism. The following
commands will force your system to be reset/switched off.

In case the softdog module is used, the following action can be performed:

----
# sync; cat /dev/watchdog & while date; do sleep 10; done
----
// # touch /dev/watchdog
// # echo 1 > /dev/watchdog

After your test was successful, you must implement the watchdog on all cluster members.

====

==== Setting up the initial cluster using `{slehainit}`

For more detailed information about setting up a cluster, refer to the sections
_Setting Up the First Node_ and _Adding the Second Node_ of the {dochaquickstart}
for {sleha} {pn15} {psp15} at {haquickstart15}.

This setup uses unicast (UCAST) for corosync communication (_-u_ option). Refer
to the {haAdminGuide15} on detailed explanations of the terms unicast/multicast.

Create an initial setup, using the `{slehainit}` command, and follow the
dialogs. Do this only on the first cluster node. Answer "no" to "Do you wish to
configure a virtual IP address" and "Do you want to configure QDevice".

To use two corosync rings make sure you have two interfaces configured and run:

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # {slehainit} -u -M -s {sapsbd1} -s {sapsbd2}
----

To use only one corosync ring leave out the _-M_ option (not recommended):

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # {slehainit} -u -s {sapsbd1} -s {sapsbd2}
----

// TODO PRIO2: for disk less SBD: {slehainit} -u -S

This command configures the basic cluster framework including:

* SSH keys
* csync2 to transfer configuration files
* SBD (at least one device, in this guide two)
* corosync (at least one ring, better two rings)
* HAWK Web interface

IMPORTANT: As requested by `{slehainit}`, change the password of the user hacluster.

==== Checking and adapting the corosync and SBD configuration

===== Checking the corosync configuration

Check the following blocks in the file _/etc/corosync/corosync.conf_.
The important parts are _udpu_ and the correct ring/IP configuration.

See also the example at the end of this document and refer to the man pages 
corosync.conf(5), votequorum(5) and corosync_overview(8) for details on parameters 
and features.

===== Adapting the SBD configuration

// TODO PRIO2: Should we add some information about SBD timing tunables?

You can skip this section if you do not have any SBD devices, but be sure to
implement another supported fencing mechanism.

See the man pages sbd(8) and stonith_sbd(7) for details.

===== Verifying the SBD device

You can skip this section if you do not have any SBD devices, but make sure to
implement a supported fencing mechanism.

It is a good practice to check if the SBD device can be accessed from both nodes
and does contain valid records. Check this for all devices configured in
_/etc/sysconfig/sbd_. You can do so, for example, by calling `cs_show_sbd_devices`.

// TODO PRIO3: Check if we need to explain the timeout parameters of the sbd device (watchdog, allocate, loop, msgwait)

IMPORTANT: The timeout values in our example are only start values.
It is a requirement that they are tuned to your environment. Refer to the
TIDs 7011346 and 7023689 for more information.

To check the current SBD entries for the various cluster nodes, you can
use `sbd list`. If all entries are `clear`, no fencing task is marked in
the SBD device.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # sbd -d {sapsbd1} -d {sapsbd2} list
0     {sapnode1}      clear
0     {sapnode1}      clear
----

For more information on SBD configuration parameters, read the
section _Using SBD as Fencing Mechanism_ of the Installation and Setup Quick Start
for {sleha} {pn15}, and the TIDs 7016880 and 7008216.

// Now it is time to restart the cluster on the first node again (`{clusterstart}`).

==== Configuring the cluster on the second node

The second node of the two nodes cluster can be integrated by starting the command
`{slehajoin}`. This command asks for the IP address or name of the first cluster
node. With this command, all needed configuration files are copied over. As a result,
the cluster is started on both nodes.

[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# {slehajoin} -c {refHost1}
----

Press _RETURN_ to acknowledge the IP address.

==== Checking the cluster for the first time

Now it is time to check and optionally start the cluster for the first
time on both nodes.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # {clusterstatus}
{sapnode1}:~ # {sbdstatus}
{sapnode2}:~ # {clusterstatus}
{sapnode2}:~ # {sbdstatus}
{sapnode1}:~ # {clusterstart}
{sapnode2}:~ # {clusterstart}
----

Check the cluster status.
First, check if all nodes have used the SBD devices.
To check the current SBD entries for the various cluster nodes, you can use `sbd list`.
If all entries are _clear_ , no fencing task is marked in the SBD device.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # sbd -d {sapsbd1} -d {sapsbd2} list
0     {sapnode1}      clear
1     {sapnode2}      clear
0     {sapnode1}      clear
1     {sapnode2}      clear
----

You can also call `cs_show_sbd_devices` again.

Next, check if all nodes have joined the cluster.
To do so, call `crm_mon`. Use the options _"-r1"_ to also see the resources that
are configured but stopped.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm_mon -r1
----

The command will show the "empty" cluster and will print something similar to the
screen output below. The most interesting pieces of information for now are that
there are two nodes in the status "online", the message "partition with quorum",
and a running SBD resource.

=== Configuring cluster properties and resources

This section describes how to configure constraints, resources, bootstrap, and STONITH,
using the `crm configure` shell command as described in section _Configuring and Managing Cluster Resources (Command Line)_
of the Administration Guide for {sleha} {pn15} {psp15} at {haAdminGuide15}#cha-ha-manual-config. The man page crm(8) might be useful, too.

Use the command `crm` to add the objects to the cluster information base (CIB). Copy the following
examples to a local file, edit the file and then load the configuration to the CIB:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # vi crm-fileXX
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-fileXX
----

==== Cluster bootstrap and more

The first example defines the cluster bootstrap options, the resource
and operation defaults. The stonith-timeout should be greater than 1.2
times the SBD msgwait timeout.

// TODO PRIO2: Discuss migration-threshold="3"

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
// ----
// {sapnode1}:~ # vi crm-bs.txt
// # enter the following to crm-bs.txt

// rsc_defaults $id="rsc-options" \
//               resource-stickiness="1000" \
//               migration-threshold="3"
// op_defaults $id="op-options" \
//                  timeout="600"
//----
----
{sapnode1}:~ # vi crm-bs.txt
# enter the following to crm-bs.txt
property cib-bootstrap-options: \

    resource-stickiness="1000" \
    migration-threshold="3"
op_defaults op-options: \
    timeout=600 \
    record-pending=true
----

Now add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-bs.txt
----

==== STONITH device
// pcmk_delay_max is set automagically nowadays
//

// ----
//
// Again, add the configuration to the cluster.
//
// [subs="attributes,quotes"]
// ----
// {sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-sbd.txt
// ----

For an advanced SBD setup, refer to the {sleha} product documentation (for example, visit
{haAdminGuide15}#pro-ha-storage-protect-fencing.
If the preferred node running the primary HANA database always should win in case of
split-brain, look up the "Predictable Static Delays" configuration example.
See also <<cha.hanasr-example-sbd>>.

For fencing with IPMI/ILO, see <<cha.hanasr-using-ipmi>>.

[[cha.hanasr-using-ipmi]]
==== Using IPMI as fencing mechanism

This section is only relevant if the recommended disk-based or diskless SBD fencing is not used.

For details about IPMI/ILO fencing, read the cluster product documentation ({haAdminGuide15}).
An example for an IPMI STONITH resource can be found in <<cha.hanasr-example-ipmi>>
of this document.

To use IPMI, the remote management boards must be compatible with the IPMI standard.

For the IPMI-based fencing, configure a primitive per-cluster
node. Each resource is responsible to fence exactly one cluster node.
Adapt the IP addresses and login user / password of the
remote management boards to the STONITH resource agent. We recommend to
create a special STONITH user instead of providing root access to the
management board. Location rules must guarantee that a host should never
run its own STONITH resource.

==== Using other fencing mechanisms

This section is only relevant if the recommended disk-based or diskless SBD fencing is not used.

We recommend to use SBD (best practice) or IPMI (second choice) as STONITH mechanism. The {sleha} product
also supports additional fencing mechanism not covered here.

For further information about fencing, read the Administration Guide for SUSE Linux Enterprise High
Availability Extension at {haAdminGuide15}. For public cloud environements, refer to your cloud provider's documentation on supported fencing mechanisms.

==== SAPHanaTopology

This step is to define the resources needed, to analyze the {HANA} topology for the replicated pair.
Prepare the changes in a text file, for example _crm-saphanatop.txt_, and load it with the command:

`crm configure load update crm-saphanatop.txt`

// TODO PRIO3: Discuss naming scheme SAPHanaTop SAPHanaCon vs old scheme

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-saphanatop.txt
# enter the following to crm-saphanatop.txt
primitive rsc_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} ocf:suse:SAPHanaTopology \
    op monitor interval="10" timeout="600" \
    op start interval="0" timeout="600" \
    op stop interval="0" timeout="300" \
    params SID="{sapsid}" InstanceNumber="{sapino}"
clone cln_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} rsc_SAPHanaTopology_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} \
    meta clone-node-max="1" interleave="true"
----

Additional information about all parameters can be found with the command:

`man ocf_suse_SAPHanaTopology`

Again, add the configuration to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-saphanatop.txt
----

The most important parameters here are SID and InstanceNumber, which are
quite self explaining in the SAP context. Beside these parameters, typical
tuneables are the timeout values or the operations (start, monitor, stop).

==== SAPHana

This step is to define the resource needed, to control the replicated {HANA} pair.
Edit the changes in a text file, for example _crm-saphana.txt_, and load it with the following command:

`crm configure load update crm-saphana.txt`

|AUTOMATED_REGISTER a|
Defines whether a former primary should be automatically registered to
be secondary of the new primary. With this parameter you can adapt the
level of system replication automation.

If set to `false`, the former primary must be manually registered. The
cluster will not start this SAP HANA RDBMS until it is registered, to avoid
double primary up situations.

|DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT |Time difference needed between two primary
time stamps if a dual-primary situation occurs. If the time difference
is less than the time gap, the cluster holds one or both instances
in a "WAITING" status. This is to give an administrator the chance to react on a
fail-over. If the complete node of the former primary crashed, the former
primary will be registered after the time difference is passed. If
"only" the SAP HANA RDBMS has crashed, the former primary will be
registered immediately. After this registration to the new primary, all
data will be overwritten by the system replication.
|=======================================================================

Additional information about all parameters of the SAPHana RA can be found with
the following command:

`man ocf_suse_SAPHana`

The most important parameters here are again SID and InstanceNumber.
Beside these parameters, typical tuneables are the timeout values for the operations (start,
promote, monitors, stop). The parameter _AUTOMATED_REGISTER_
can be used to adapt the level of system replication automation.
The general resource meta attribute _priority_ can be used together with the optional
priority fencing to make an HANA primary node surviving in case of split-brain.
Please see the {sleHA} product documentation for details
({haAdminGuide15}/#pro-ha-storage-protect-fencing).

==== Adding a virtual IP address for the primary site

The last resource to be added for SAPHanaSR is covering the virtual IP address.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# vi crm-vip.txt
# enter the following to crm-vip.txt

primitive rsc_ip_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino} ocf:heartbeat:IPaddr2 \
    op monitor interval="10s" timeout="20s" \
    params ip="{sapip1srv1}"
----

Load the file to the cluster.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-vip.txt
----

In most on-premise installations, only the parameter _ip_ needs to be set to the virtual IP address to be presented to the client systems.
Public cloud environments often need specific settings.

==== Constraints for SAPHanaSR

Two constraints are organizing the correct placement of the virtual IP
address for the client database access and the start order between the
two resource agents SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology.

==== Adding the cluster resource for the non-replicated {SAPHANA} database

For the non-replicated {SAPHANA} database, a new resource is added to the cluster.
In previous versions of this document we used the resource agent `SAPDatabase` to control that
database. The new architecture now uses `SAPInstance` to start, stop and monitor this
cluster component. The reason for that change is that `SAPDatabase` is using the
{SAP} host agent API. The {SAP} host agent itself needs user secure keys to
communicate with the cluster. This configuration is too complex and error-prone.
`SAPInstance` uses the sapstartsrv API to do the work. This should solve the issue.
The new concept has already been published in a {SUSE} #towardsZeroDowntime blog at
https://suse.com/c/sap-hana-cost-optimized-an-alternative-route-is-available/

  op start interval="0" timeout="600" \

  op stop interval="0" timeout="300"

==== Adding cluster rules for automatic shutdown of the non-replicated {SAPHANA}

In the following example, again {sapnode1} and {sapnode2} are used as the two active cluster nodes.

  rsc_ip_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}
order ord_{sapnpsid}stop_before_{sapsid}-promote mandatory: rsc_SAP_{sapnpsid}_HDB{sapnpino}:stop \
  msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}:promote
----

Load the resource definition into the cluster

----
{sapnode1}:~ # crm configure load update crm-con.txt

////
==== Adding second virtual IP address for an active/active read-enabled scenario

This step is optional. If you have an active/active {saphana} system replication with a read-enabled secondary, it is possible to integrate the
needed second virtual IP address into the cluster. This is done by adding a second virtual IP address resource and a location constraint binding
the address to the secondary site.

The lists of tests will be further enhanced in one of the next updates of this document.

For any cluster setup testing is crucial. Make sure that all test cases derived
from your organizations or from customer expectations are fully implemented and successfully passed.
Otherwise the project is likely to fail in production.

If not described differently, the test prerequisite is always that both
nodes are booted, normal members of the cluster and that the HANA RDBMS is running.
There are no left-over migration constraints or resource failures contained in
the cluster information base (CIB). The system replication is in sync (_SOK_) and
the cluster is not performing any action, this means it is in the state _S_IDLE_.

This can be checked, for example, with the following command sequence:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm_mon -1r
# crm configure show | grep cli-
# SAPHanaSR-showAttr
# cs_clusterstate -i
----

See also the man pages `SAPHanaSR-showAttr(8)`, `crm_mon(8)`, `crm(8)`, `cs_clusterstate(8)`,
`SAPHanaSR_maintenance_examples(7)`.

[[cha.hana-sr.administrate]]
== Administration

=== Dos and don'ts

In your project, you should:

* Define STONITH before adding other resources to the cluster.
* Do intensive testing.
* Tune the timeouts of operations of SAPHana and SAPHanaTopology.
* Start with the parameter values PREFER_SITE_TAKEOVER=”false”, AUTOMATED_REGISTER=”false” and
DUPLICATE_PRIMARY_TIMEOUT=”7200”.
* Always wait for pending cluster actions to finish before doing something.
* Set up a test cluster for testing configuration changes and administrative
procedure before applying them on the production cluster.

In your project, avoid:

* Rapidly changing/changing back a cluster configuration, such as setting
nodes to standby and online again or stopping/starting the multi-state
resource.
* Creating a cluster without proper time synchronization or unstable name
resolutions for hosts, users and groups.
* Using site names other than the ones already known by the cluster when
manually re-registering a site.
* Adding location rules for the clone, multi-state or IP resource. Only location
rules mentioned in this setup guide are allowed. For public cloud refer to the
cloud specific documentation.
* Using {SAP} tools for attempting start/stop/takeover actions on a database
while the cluster is in charge of managing that database.

IMPORTANT: As "migrating" or "moving" resources in crm-shell, HAWK or other
tools would add client-prefer location rules, support is limited to maintenance
procedures described in this document. See <<cluster-tests>> and
<<sec-maintenance>> for proven procedures.

=== Monitoring and tools

You can use the High Availability Web Console (HAWK), {hana} Cockpit, {hana} Studio and different
command line tools for cluster status requests.

==== HAWK – cluster status and more

You can use a Web browser to check the cluster status.

.Cluster Status in HAWK
image::SAPHanaSR-ScaleUp-HAWK-Status-SLE12.png[scaledwidth=100%]
//TODO PRIO3: SAPHanaSR-ScaleUp-HAWK-Status-SLE15.png

If you set up the cluster using {slehainit} and you have installed all packages
as described above, your system will provide a very useful Web interface. You
can use this graphical Web interface to get an overview of the complete cluster
status, perform administrative tasks or configure resources and cluster bootstrap
parameters. Read the product manuals for a complete documentation of this user
interface. For the {HANA} system replication {usecase} scenario the use of HAWK
should follow the guidance given in this guide.

==== {hana} Cockpit

Database-specific administration and checks can be done with {hana} Cockpit.
Before trying start/stop/takeover for the database, make sure the cluster is not
in charge of managing the respective resource. See also <<sec-maintenance>>.

// DONE PRIO1: We need a HANA Cockpit screen-shot here

.{hana} Cockpit – database directory

//image::hana_studio_landscape_2021.png[scaledwidth=100%]
image::saphana-cockpit01.png[scaledwidth=100%]

==== Cluster command line tools

A simple overview can be obtained by calling `crm_mon`. Using option
`-r` shows also stopped but already configured resources. Option `-1`
tells `crm_mon` to output the status once instead of periodically.

See the manual page crm_mon(8) for details. If you have installed the ClusterTools2
package, also have a look at manual pages cs_clusterstate(8) and cs_show_hana_info(8).

==== SAPHanaSR command line tools

To show some SAPHana or SAPHanaTopology resource agent internal values, call the
program `SAPHanaSR-showAttr`. The internal values, the storage location and their
parameter names may change in a next version of this document. The command
`SAPHanaSR-showAttr` will always fetch the values from the correct storage
location.

Do not use cluster commands like `crm_attribute` to fetch the values directly
from the cluster. If you use such commands, your methods will be broken when
you need to move an attribute to a different storage place or even out of the
cluster. At first _SAPHanaSR-showAttr_ is a test program only and should not be
used for automated system monitoring.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
 {sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-showAttr
 Host \ Attr clone_state remoteHost roles       ... site    srmode sync_state ...
 ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 {sapnode1}      PROMOTED    {sapnode2}     4:P:master1:... {sapsite1}      sync  PRIM       ...
 {sapnode2}      DEMOTED     {sapnode1}     4:S:master1:... {sapsite2}      sync  SOK        ...
----

`SAPHanaSR-showAttr` also supports other output formats such as *script*. The
script format is intended to allow running filters. The SAPHanaSR package beginning
with version 0.153 additionally provides a filter engine `SAPHanaSR-filter`.
Combining `SAPHanaSR-showAttr` with output format script and `SAPHanaSR-filter`,
you can define effective queries:

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-showAttr --format=script | \
   SAPHanaSR-filter --search='remote'
Mon Jun 21 19:55:45 2021; Hosts/{sapnode1}/remoteHost={sapnode2}
Mon Jun 21 19:55:45 2021; Hosts/{sapnode2}/remoteHost={sapnode1}
----

`SAPHanaSR-replay-archive` can help to analyze the SAPHanaSR attribute values from
`hb_report` (`crm_report`) archives. This allows post mortem analyses.

In our example, the administrator killed the primary {hana} instance using the
command `HDB kill-9`. This happened around 8:10 pm.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----
{sapnode1}:~ # hb_report -f 19:00
INFO: {sapnode1}# The report is saved in ./hb_report-Mon-21-Jun-2021.tar.gz
INFO: {sapnode1}# Report timespan: 06/21/21 19:00:00 - 06/21/21 20:26:33
INFO: {sapnode1}# Thank you for taking time to create this report.
{sapnode1}:~ # SAPHanaSR-replay-archive --format=script \
    ./hb_report-Mon-21-Jun-2021.tar.gz | \
    SAPHanaSR-filter --search='roles' --filterDouble
Mon Jun 21 19:38:01 2021; Hosts/{sapnode1}/roles=4:P:master1:master:worker:master
Mon Jun 21 19:38:01 2021; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=4:S:master1:master:worker:master
Mon Jun 21 20:11:37 2021; Hosts/{sapnode1}/roles=1:P:master1::worker:
Mon Jun 21 20:15:43 2021; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=4:P:master1:master:worker:master
----

In the above example the attributes indicate that at the beginning {sapnode1}
was running primary (4:P) and {sapnode2} was running secondary (4:S).

At 20:11 (CET) suddenly the primary on {sapnode1} died - it was falling down to 1:P.

The cluster did jump in and initiated a takeover. At 20:15 (CET) the former secondary
was detected as new running master (changing from 4:S to 4:P).
See manual pages SAPHanaSR-showAttr(8), SAPHanaSR-replay-archive(8) and crm_report(8)
for more information.

==== {hana} LandscapeHostConfiguration

To check the status of an SAP HANA database and to find out if the
cluster should react, use the script *landscapeHostConfiguration*
as Linux user _<sid>adm_.

[subs="attributes,quotes"]
----

{sapnode1}:~> HDBSettings.sh landscapeHostConfiguration.py
| Host   | Host   | ... NameServer   | NameServer  | IndexServer | IndexServer |
|        | Active | ... Config Role  | Actual Role | Config Role | Actual Role |
| ------ | ------ | ... ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| {sapnode1} | yes    | ... master 1     | master      | worker      | master      |

overall host status: ok
----

Following the SAP HA guideline, the SAPHana resource agent interprets the return
codes in the following way:

.Interpretation of Return Codes
[width="100%",cols="15%,85%",options="header",]
|=======================================================================
|Return Code |Interpretation
|4 |{hana} database is up and OK. The cluster does interpret this as a
correctly running database.

|3 |{hana} database is up and in status info. The cluster does
interpret this as a correctly running database.

|2 |{hana} database is up and in status warning. The cluster does
interpret this as a correctly running database.

|1 |{hana} database is down. If the database should be up and is not
down by intention, this could trigger a takeover.

|0 |Internal Script Error – to be ignored.
|=======================================================================

=== Maintenance

[[sec-maintenance]]

To receive updates for the operating system or the {sleha},
it is recommended to register your systems to either a local {suma}, to {rmtool} ({rmt}),
or remotely with {scc}.
For more information, visit the respective Web pages:
{sumalandingpage}
{rmtGuide15}
{sccfaq}
Examples for maintenance tasks are also given in manual page SAPHanaSR_maintenance_examples(7).

==== Updating the operating system and cluster

For an update of {sles4sap} packages including cluster software, follow the
rolling update procedure defined in the product documentation
of the {sle} {ha} Extension Administration Guide, chapter _Upgrading Your Cluster and Updating Software Packages_ at
{haAdminGuide15}#cha-ha-migration.

==== Updating {hana} - seamless {hana} maintenance

For updating SAP HANA database systems in system replication, you need to follow
the defined SAP processes. This section describes the steps required before and
after the update procedure to get the system replication automated again.

{SUSE} has optimized the {hana} maintenance process in the cluster.
The improved procedure only sets the multi-state resource to maintenance and
keeps the rest of the cluster (SAPHanaTopology clones and IPaddr2 vIP resource)
still active. Using the updated procedure allows a seamless {hana} maintenance
in the cluster, as the virtual IP address can automatically follow the running
primary.

//TODO: PRIO2 HINT for new wizard?!?!?!

Prepare the cluster not to react on the maintenance work to be done on
the {HANA} database systems. Set the multi-state resource to `maintenance`.

.Main {hana} Update procedure
==============================
Pre-Update Tasks:: For the multi-state-resource set the maintenance mode as follows:
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource>
----
+
The <multi-state-resource> in the guide at hand is `msl_SAPHana_{sapsid}_HDB{sapino}`.

Update:: Process the SAP Update for both SAP HANA database systems. This
procedure is described by SAP.

Post-Update Tasks:: Expect the primary/secondary roles to be exchanged after the
maintenance. Therefore, tell the cluster to forget about these states and to
reprobe the updated SAP HANA database systems.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource refresh <multi-state-resource>
----
+
After the SAP HANA update is complete on both sites, tell the cluster about the
end of the maintenance process. This allows the cluster to actively control and
monitor the {sap} again.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource> off
----

==============================

==== Migrating an {HANA} primary

In the following procedures, we assume the primary runs on node 1 and the secondary
on node 2. The goal is to "exchange" the roles of the nodes: the primary should
then run on node 2 and the secondary should run on node 1.

There are different methods to get the exchange of the roles done. The
following procedure shows how to tell the cluster to "accept" a role change via
native HANA commands.

// TODO PRIO2: Check for takeover with handshake

.Migrating an {HANA} primary using {sap} Toolset
==============================
Pre-Migration Tasks:: Set the multi-state resource to `maintenance`. This can be done on any
cluster node.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource-name>
----

// TODO PRIO2: Check -sr_takeover with 'handshake'

Manual Takeover Process::
* Stop the primary SAP HANA database system. Enter the command in our
example on node1 as user _{refsidadm}_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> HDB stop
----
+
* Before proceeding, make sure the primary HANA database is stopped.
* Start the takeover process on the secondary SAP HANA database system.
Enter the command in our example on node 2 as user _{refsidadm}_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_takeover
----
+
* Register the former primary to become the new secondary. Enter the
command in our example on node1 as user _{refsidadm}_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost={sapnode2} --remoteInstance={sapino} \
 --replicationMode=sync --name={sapsite1} \
 --operationMode=logreplay
----
+
* Start the new secondary SAP HANA database system. Enter the command in
our example on node1 as user _{refsidadm}_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> HDB start
----

Post-Migration Tasks::
* Wait some time until `SAPHanaSR-showAttr` shows both {SAPHANA} database
systems to be up again (field roles must start with the digit 4). The new
secondary should have role "S" (for secondary).
+
* Tell the cluster to forget about the former multi-state roles and to
re-monitor the failed master. The command can be submitted on any
cluster node as user root.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource refresh <multi-state-resource-name>
----
+
* Set the multi-state resource to the status managed again. The command
can be submitted on any cluster node as user root.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource maintenance <multi-state-resource-name> off
----
==============================

The following paragraphs explain how to use the cluster to partially automate the
migration. For the described attribute query using `SAPHanaSR-showAttr` and
`SAPHanaSR-filter` you need at least `SAPHanaSR` with package version 0.153.

.Moving an {HANA} primary using the Cluster Toolset
==============================
* Create a "move away" from this node rule by using the *force* option.
+
[subs="attributes,specialchars,quotes"]
----
# crm resource move <multi-state-resource-name> *force*
----
+
Because of the "move away" (*force*) rule, the cluster will *stop* the
current primary. After that, run a *promote* on the secondary site if the system
replication was in sync before. You should not migrate the primary if
the status of the system replication is not in sync (SFAIL).
+
IMPORTANT: Migration without the *force* option will cause a takeover without the
former primary to be stopped. Only the migration with *force* option is supported.
+
NOTE: The crm resource command *move* was previously named *migrate*. The *migrate*
command is still valid but already known as obsolete.

* Wait until the secondary has completely taken over to be the new primary role. You
  see this using the command line tool `SAPHanaSR-showAttr`. Now check for the
  attributes "roles" for the new primary. It must start with "*4:P*".
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----

Mon Jun 21 19:38:50 2021; Hosts/{sapnode2}/roles=*4:P*:master1:master:worker:master
----

* If you have set up the parameter value `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`, you can skip this step. In
other cases you now need to register the old primary. Enter the command
in our example on node1 as user _{refsidadm}_.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
~> hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost={sapnode2} --remoteInstance={sapino} \

----

* Clear the ban rules of the resource to allow the cluster to start the new secondary.
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]
----
# crm resource clear <multi-state-resource-name>
----
+
NOTE: The crm resource command *clear* was previously named *unmigrate*. The *unmigrate*
command is still valid but already known as obsolete.

* Wait until the new secondary has started. You
  see this using the command line tool `SAPHanaSR-showAttr` and check for the
  attributes "roles" for the new primary. It must start with "*4:S*".
+
[subs="specialchars,attributes,quotes"]

----

* You should revert the {HANA} roles back soon, to get the non-replicated database also up and running again.

==============================

==== Reverting to original {HANA} roles after takeover to secondary site

In the following procedure the HANA primary role is moved back to node1. node2
is registered as the new secondary and the non-replicated HANA is started on node2.
The site name to be registered is {sapsite1}. Make sure this is the exact same as before.

.Revert {HANA} Roles back after Failure on {sapnode1}
==============================

=== Support
// TODO PRIO3: To be combined with section "Feedback"

There are two channels available for opening support requests. For issues which might also need {SAP} to
investigate, the preferred method is to open an {SAP} ticket on support queue BC-OP-LNX-SUSE. See {SAP} note
1056161; find the link in <<sap-notes>>.

The other channel is to use the SUSE support only. {SUSE} customer center (SCC) is the central access point for managing support entitlements
and for opening support requests. It is available at {scclandingpage}/login.

More information on how to access support can be foud at https://www.suse.com/support/ and https://www.suse.com/support/faq/.

The {sles4sap} product documentation explains how to collect information usually needed during a support request:
 https://documentation.suse.com/sles/15-SP2/html/SLES-all/cha-adm-support.html.

See also manual pages crm_report(8), supportconfg(8), cs_show_hana_info(8),
ha_related_suse_tids(7).

In addition, there are {SUSE} support Technical Information Documents (TIDs) available, for example:

* Diagnostic Data Collection Master TID (7024037)
* Indepth HANA Cluster Debug Data Collection (PACEMAKER, SAP) (7022702)
* SLES for SAP - How To Engage SAP and SUSE to address Product Issues (7021182)
// * Basic health check for two-node SAP HANA performance based model (7022984)

The SUSE support knowledgebase containing the TIDs is available at https://www.suse.com/support/kb/.


////
* Set the primary node to be standby.

`crm node standby {sapnode1}`

The cluster will stop the primary SAP HANA database and, if the system
replication was in sync, process the takeover on the secondary site.

Wait until the former secondary has completely taken over to be the new
primary.

If you have set up `AUTOMATED_REGISTER="true"`, you can skip this step. In
other cases you now need to register the old primary. Enter the command
in our example on node1 as user _{refsidadm}_.

`hdbnsutil -sr_register --remoteHost={sapnode2} --remoteInstance={sapino} --replicationMode=sync --name={sapsite1} --operationMode=logreplay`

Set the standby node to be online again.

`crm node online {sapnode1}`

  Optionally configure an administration virtual IP
  address. The purpose of this IP address is to
  provide a single IP that can be used to interact
  with the cluster, rather than using the IP address
  of any specific cluster node.

Do you wish to configure a virtual IP address (y/n)? n

Configure Qdevice/Qnetd:
  QDevice participates in quorum decisions. With the assistance of
  a third-party arbitrator Qnetd, it provides votes so that a cluster
  is able to sustain more node failures than standard quorum rules
  allow. It is recommended for clusters with an even number of nodes
  and highly recommended for 2 node clusters.

Do you want to configure QDevice (y/n)? n
  Done (log saved to /var/log/crmsh/ha-cluster-bootstrap.log)

=== Example cluster configuration

The following example shows a complete crm configuration for a two-node cluster
({sapnode1}, {sapnode2}) and a replicated {hana} database with SID {sapsid}
and instance number {sapino}. Priority fencing prefers the HANA primary in case of split-brain.
The stand-alone database has SID {sapnpsid} and instance number {sapnpino}.
The virtual IP address in the example is {sapip1srv1}.
