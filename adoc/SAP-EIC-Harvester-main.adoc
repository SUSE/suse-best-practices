== Prerequisites

// TODO maybe just replace with Rancher4SAP?

* Get subscriptions for:
** {rancher4SAP} *
** {sle_ha} **

+++*+++ The {rancher4SAP} subscription includes support for all required components like {slm}, {rancher} and {harvester}.

+++**+++ Only needed if you want to set up {rancher} in a high availability setup without the  {harvester} Load Balancer feature.

Additionally,

* check the storage requirements.

* create a or get access to a private container registry.

* get an SAP S-user ID to access software and documentation from SAP.

* read the relevant SAP documentation:

** https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839[Release Note for SAP Edge Integration Cell]

** https://me.sap.com/notes/2946788[Release Note for SAP ELM Bridge]

== Landscape Overview

To run {eic} in a production-ready and supported way, you need to set up multiple Kubernetes clusters and their respective nodes.
These include a Kubernetes cluster where {rancher} is installed to set up and manage both production and non-production clusters.
For this {rancher} cluster, we recommend using three Kubernetes nodes and a Load Balancer.

When using {harvester}, you can provision all virtual machines required for the example landscape.
While the VMs for the {rancher} cluster must be created directly in {harvester}, the Kubernetes clusters and the related virtual machines can be created through {rancher}.

The {eic} will need to run in a dedicated Kubernetes cluster.
For an HA setup of this cluster, we recommend using three Kubernetes control planes and three Kubernetes worker nodes.

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

For a graphical overview of what is needed, take a look at the landscape overview:

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-Architecture.svg[title=Architecture EIC Cluster,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

* The grey rectangles represent physical servers (hardware).
* The orange rectangles represent {harvester} instances.
* The blue rectangles represent Kubernetes clusters.
* The green rectangles represent virtual machines.

We will use this graphic overview in the guide to illustrate what the next step is and what it is for.

NOTE: If you want to test upgrades of {harvester}, we recommend setting up an additional {harvester} cluster and separate the production {eic} instances from the development and test instances.

Starting with installing {harvester}, we will walk you through all the steps you need to take to get a fully set-up Kubernetes landscape for deploying {eic}.

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

== {harvester}

The first step is to set up {harvester}.
Referring to our overview, this means we will now focus on the orange rectangles displayed in the diagram.

image::SAP-EIC-Harvester-Architecture-Virtualization.svg[title=Architecture EIC Cluster SUSE Virtualization,scaledwidth=99%,opts=inline,Embedded]

include::SAP-EIC-Harvester.adoc[tag=harvester-intro]

The advantage of using {harvester} for {eic} is its ability to easily spin up Kubernetes clusters, 
with virtual machines being automatically deployed. Additionally, there is no need to install {lh}, 
as {harvester} provides a built-in storage class, offering a convenient way to supply storage to {eic}.

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

include::SAP-EIC-Harvester.adoc[tags=harvester-setup;harvester-image-upload]

When you have uploaded the OS image that you want to use, you can now set up virtual machines.

In this guide, we will describe the example of setting up three virtual machines to host the {rancher} cluster you can use later to create and manage your {eic} clusters.

[#instanceLabels]
Make sure to add *Instance Labels* to your machines if you plan to use the {harvester} Load Balancer feature. This is described more in detail in this guide at xref:SAP-EIC-Harvester-main.adoc#lbconfig[].
For our example, we will use:

[options="header"]
|===
|Key |Value
|application|rancher-mgt
|===

A detailed overview of how to set up the virtual machines can be found at:
include::SAP-EIC-Harvester.adoc[tag=harvester-VM-create]

<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

== Installing {rancher} cluster

By now, you should have {harvester} installed and be able to deploy virtual machines.
Next, we will focus on setting up {rancher}.
Referring to our overview, this means we will now cover the first blue rectangles displayed in the diagram.

include::SAP-K8s-HA.adoc[tags=rancher-haproxy-preps]

In this guide, we will describe two methods for setting up a load balancer, either using HAProxy <<haproxy>> or the {harvester} load balancer feature <<harvlb>>.

== Installing RKE2 using {rancher}

At this point, {harvester} and {rancher} should be up and running and integrated.
Regarding our overview, we will now focus on the EIC-related cluster, represented by the three blue boxes.

include::SAP-Rancher-RKE2-Installation.adoc[tags=!install-rke2-custom]

As soon as the Kubernetes cluster is ready, your next step is to install {pg} and {redis}.

If you already have {pg} and {redis} deployed, you can skip the next chapter and follow the instructions at <<eicPreperation>>.
If you do not have an instance of {pg} or {redis} available for {eic}, we will guide you through the process of deploying them 
in a Kubernetes cluster in the following chapter.

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>

== Installing the mandatory databases

In the following chapter, we provide an example for setting up {redis} and {pg}.

NOTE: Keep in mind that the descriptions and instructions provided may differ from the 
deployment requirements for your specific infrastructure and use cases.

=== Installing {redis}

// https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/prepare-your-kubernetes-cluster#redis-data-store-requirements

Before deploying {redis}, ensure that the requirements described at
https://me.sap.com/notes/3247839 are met.

Also, make sure you understand what grade of persistence you want to achieve for your {redis} cluster.
For more information about persistence in {redis}, see
https://redis.io/docs/management/persistence/.

=== Installing {pg}

NOTE: Keep in mind that the descriptions and instructions provided may differ from the 
deployment requirements for your specific infrastructure and use cases.

=== Configuring the {istio} Service Mesh

This section guides you through configuring the {istio} Service Mesh for the Restricted Access feature on {eic}.

=== Configuring the Monitoring

This section covers the deployment of key monitoring and observability tools
that integrate with the Istio Service Mesh configured previously in <<serviceMesh>>.

[#eicPreperation]
== Preparing the cluster for {eic}

include::SAP-EIC-Harvester.adoc[tags=harvester-kubernetes-storage;harvester-lb, leveloffset=+1]

If you are using a network without DHCP, you will need to create an IP Pool.
For instructions, refer to the xref:SAP-EIC-Harvester-main.adoc#ippool[previous chapter].

After this is done, a Kubernetes cluster created as outlined in xref:SAP-Rancher-RKE2-Installation.adoc#installRKE2Harvester[the previous chapter] 
will automatically be assigned an IP address from the pool for Services of type LoadBalancer.

++++
<?pdfpagebreak?>
++++

== Installing {eic}

// include::SAP-EIC.adoc[]
At this point, you should be ready to deploy {eic}.
Follow the instructions at https://help.sap.com/docs/integration-suite/sap-integration-suite/setting-up-and-managing-edge-integration-cell
to install {eic} in your prepared environments.

=== Using self-signed certificates

In this chapter, we will explain how to create self-signed certificates and how to make them available within Kubernetes. 
We will describe two possible solutions to do this. You can create everything on the operation system layer or you also can use `cert-manager` in your downstream cluster.

include::SAP-EIC-General.adoc[tags=self-signed-certificates]

You should then have the files _server.pem_, _server.key_ and _chained.pem_ that can be used for your applications such as Redis or PostgresSQL.
