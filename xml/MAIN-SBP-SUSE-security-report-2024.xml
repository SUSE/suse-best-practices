  </itemizedlist>

  <para>The SUSE Security Team addresses all aspects of software security on an ongoing basis. 
   Software security cannot be thought of as a state you can achieve at a specific point in time. Instead, it
   is a process that must be executed with professional expertise and continuous development. This
   persistent focus is what has given open source software, Linux and SUSE an excellent reputation
   for security. Our SUSE Solution Security team is responsible for handling all SUSE product-related 
   security incidents. In that team, clear and well-defined roles are assigned for tracking new incidents 
   and coordinating needed updates. The team closely collaborates with all SUSE software engineer specialists.</para>

  <para>The objective of this report is to provide a summary of all security vulnerabilities which
   affected SUSE products in calendar year 2024. We will go into details on the high impact
   vulnerabilities and elaborate on how we responded to these incidents. For a better understanding 
   of our classification mechanisms, we have described our rating system along with the equivalency 
   of each rating to the CVSS v3.1 scoring calculator. Our Solution Security team has begun CVSS 4.0 scoring, 
   and we will be displaying both CVSS v3.1 and CVSS v4.0 on our CVE Web pages for your information and reference.</para>

 <!--<sect1 xml:id="sec-background">
  <title>Background</title>

  <para>A modern Linux operating system, such as SUSE Linux Enterprise Server for enterprise use or
   the openSUSE community distribution for home use, features a rich set of security programs and
   functions. Those range from access control, intrusion prevention and detection, flexible and
   trustworthy authentication mechanisms, encryption for files and network connections, file
   integrity checking utilities, to network analysis tools and monitoring/logging utilities for your
   system. To complement this, there are advanced tools that help you to securely configure and
   administer your system, and to securely download and install update packages. These utilities are
   standard in SUSE products. The update packages fix security bugs that have been found after your
   product has been released. The security features of your Linux system are waiting for you to
   explore them. SUSE encourages our customers to take advantage of them to further improve the
   level of privacy and security that is built into every system by default. </para>

  <para>Programs are usually written by humans, and humans make mistakes. By consequence, all
   software can contain errors. Some of these errors appear as instabilities (the software or the
   entire system crashes), while others may not have any apparent, visible effect. However, some
   software errors may introduce a security risk. A local or a remote attacker may be able to feed
   specially drafted data to the software which takes advantage of the programming error. In the
   case of a remotely exploitable bug, the data comes from an attached network device, such as a
   cable or DSL modem, or a wireless network interface card. The application then either crashes,
   resulting in a Denial of Service (DoS) attack. Or it executes code that originates from the
   attacker, transferring control over the execution context from what the programmer intended to
   what the attacker has in mind for the exploitation of the error. Depending on the functionality 
   of the software, the resulting security breach may pose a low or high security risk to your data 
   and system, potentially giving an attacker the opportunity to delete, modify or even steal your 
   data or exploit the system for their own purposes.</para>

  <para>The SUSE Solution Security team is responsible for handling all SUSE product-related
   security incidents. In that team, clear and well-defined roles are assigned for tracking new
   incidents and coordinating needed updates. The team works with all SUSE engineering software
   specialists.</para>

  <para>We use multiple sources to understand security incidents. These sources include the Mitre
   and NVD Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) databases, various security mailing lists (OSS
   security, Linux distros, distros, bugtraq, and full-disclosure), direct reports, and other Linux
   vendors databases. We are also part of various pre-notification mailing lists for software
   components, like Xen, Samba, X.ORG. Confidential pre-notifications about vulnerabilities will be
   treated according to established responsible disclosure procedures.</para>

<!-- <sect1 xml:id="sec-incident-rating-tracking">
  <title>Incident rating and tracking</title>

  <para>We rate the severity of incidents with two different systems, a simplified rating system and
   the Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) v3.1 scoring system. The CVSS is an open framework
   for communicating the characteristics and severity of software vulnerabilities. It is being
   developed by the US-based non-profit organization FIRST.org: Its main goal is to assign the right
   score to a vulnerability to help security administrators prioritize responses and resources to
   specific threats. CVSS v3.1 scoring consists of three metric groups: Base, Temporal, and
   Environmental. The Base group represents the intrinsic qualities of a vulnerability that are
   constant over time and across user environments. The Temporal group reflects the characteristics
   of a vulnerability that change over time. The Environmental group represents the characteristics
   of a vulnerability that are unique to a user's environment. The Base metrics produce a score
   ranging from 0 to 10, which can then be modified by scoring the Temporal and Environmental
   metrics. A CVSS score is also represented as a vector string, a compressed textual representation
   of the values used to derive the score. Today, SUSE uses the Base score methodology to evaluate
   vulnerabilities throughout the support life cycle of our products. SUSE keeps the right to adjust
   the final score of the vulnerability as more details become known and available throughout the
   analysis. The most current CVSS resources can be found at <link
    xlink:href="https://www.first.org/cvss/"/> . The CVSS v3.1 calculator used by SUSE could be
   found at <link xlink:href="https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1"/>. The framework is
   measuring the severity of a given vulnerability, not the associated risk alone. The scoring of
   any vulnerability may vary with different analysts hence the final score could be slightly
   different between vendors impacted by that vulnerability. For a more accurate assessment of the
   impact, vendors and application owners must always consider factors outside of CVSS such as
   exposure or threat.</para>

  <para> The security incidents are tracked in our own workflow system. Technical details are
   tracked in the SUSE bug-tracking system, and the updated software package is built, processed,
   and published by our internal <quote>Open Build System</quote>. Internal Service Level Agreements
   (SLAs) corresponding to the severity rating are monitored and reviewed regularly. Our packagers
   backport the required security fixes to our version of the software. To protect the stability of
   our customer setups, we only rarely do minor version upgrades. After receiving fixes for the
   affected software, four eye reviews cross-check the source patches. Several automated checks
   verify source and binary compatibility and the completeness of patch meta information. They also
   check whether patches can be installed without problems. Dedicated QA teams provide integration,
   bugfix, and regression testing for all updates before they are released to our customers. After
   the release of an update, automated processes publish the updates, update notices, and cross
   reference information on our CVE index pages and machine-readable OVAL and CVRF XML
   information.</para>

  <para>For a better understanding of our classification mechanisms, we have described
   our rating system along with the equivalency of each rating to the CVSS v3.1 scoring
   calculator:</para>

  <title>When to prefer version upgrades over backports</title>

  <para> It is a general policy rule that no new upstream versions of a package are introduced into
   our enterprise products. This rule is not an absolute rule however. For certain types of
   packages, in particular antivirus software, security concerns weigh heavier than the conservative
   approach that is preferable from the perspective of quality assurance. For packages in that
   class, occasionally newer versions are introduced to a released version of an enterprise product
   line. </para>

  <para>Sometimes also for other package types the decision is made to introduce a new version 
   instead of a backport. This happens when producing a backport is not economically feasible or 
   if there is a very relevant technical reason for introducing the newer version.</para>

   <title>CVE-2024-3094 (supply chain attack against xz)</title>

   <bridgehead>Overview</bridgehead>
   <para>SUSE received notification of a supply chain attack against the <package>xz</package> compression tool 
    and <package>liblzma5</package> library. </para>

   <para>Security Researcher Andres Freund reported to Debian that the <package>xz</package> / <package>liblzma</package> 
    library had been backdoored. Malicious code was discovered in the upstream tarballs of <package>xz</package>, 
    starting with version 5.6.0. This backdoor was introduced in the upstream GitHub <package>xz</package> project with
    release 5.6.0 in February 2024. Through a series of complex obfuscations, the <package>liblzma</package> build process 
    extracts a prebuilt object file from a disguised test file existing in the source code, which is then used to modify specific 
    functions in the <package>liblzma</package> code. This results in a modified liblzma library that among other malicious 
    functionalities added a backdoor to allow the attacker arbitrary code execution via <package>ssh</package>.</para>

   <bridgehead>Solution</bridgehead>
   <para>To maintain product integrity, SUSE Linux Enterprise and openSUSE Leap are built in isolation from openSUSE 
    Tumbleweed. This prevents the automatic inclusion of Tumbleweed's code, functionalities, and characteristics. 
    Rigorous analysis has confirmed that the malicious file present in Tumbleweed is not incorporated into SUSE Linux 
    Enterprise or Leap. Moreover, SUSE has verified that SUSE Linux Enterprise BCI, SUSE Rancher, SUSE Edge, and SUSE 
    Multi-Linux Support (formerly SUSE Liberty Linux) remain unaffected. SUSE has not released <package>xz</package>
    versions 5.6.0 or 5.6.1 in any product offering other than openSUSE Tumbleweed. We will continue to monitor this 
    situation and issue updates as necessary.</para>

    <para> Following this incident, SUSE conducted internal and external brainstorming sessions to identify mitigations 
     against supply chain attacks. A summary of these discussions is available on our opensuse.org brainstorming page. 
     We have already begun implementing several of these ideas, recognizing that no single solution fully eliminates 
     such threats.</para>

  <sect2 xml:id="sec-rapid-reset-attack">
   <title>CVE-2023-44487: HTTP/2 <emphasis role="bold">Rapid Reset</emphasis> attack</title>

   <bridgehead>Overview</bridgehead>
   <para>In August 2023, Amazon Web Services, Cloudflare and Google noticed a new type of 
    distributed denial-of-service (DDos) attacks on their networks. These attacks had record breaking sizes, 
    three times bigger than previous attacks.</para>

   <para>As it turned out, the problem that was exploited was not an implementation bug, but an issue 
    inside the internal design of the HTTP/2 protocol itself. The principle of the 
    <emphasis role="bold">Rapid Reset</emphasis> attack is quite simple.</para>
   
   <para>With HTTP/1.1, all requests to the server are processed serially on one connection. 
    The client is sending a request, the server will read and process it and send a response. Then the next request is processed.
    The newer HTTP/2 protocol allows multiple bidirectional streams via a single TCP connection. 
    A client can therefore send several requests at the same time, which are then answered by the server. 
    This results in a much higher utilization of each connection.</para>
   
   <para>The <emphasis role="bold">Rapid Reset</emphasis> attack now uses the fact that each of those 
    inner streams can be canceled at any point in time via an RST_STREAM frame. This can be done even before 
    data has been transmitted back to the client. The problem that arises is as follows: 
    The request is processed by the server, and for this purposes, resources are allocated per stream. 
    These resources must be deleted again a moment later when the RST_STREAM frame has arrived.</para>
   
   <para>This comes at almost no cost for the attacker, but depending on the server implementation, 
    it can result in significant resource utilization for the victim.</para>

   <bridgehead>Solution</bridgehead>
   <para>Several upstream projects updated their code to implement or extent the mitigation mechanisms 
    that prevent or lower the impact of those attacks. This is usually done by setting a reset rate limit.</para>

   <title>CVE-2023-48795: SSH prefix truncation attack (aka Terrapin Attack)</title>

   <bridgehead>Overview</bridgehead>
   <para> Security researchers from the Ruhr University Bochum have published a new attack on 
    the SSH v2 protocol, which allows active person-in-the-middle attackers to impact SSH connections 
    by removing initial encrypted SSH packets.</para>
   
   <para>This can lead to protocol security downgrades or similar problems. 
   Changing SSH packages or injecting new encrypted SSH packages is not possible with this attack.</para>
   
   <para>Software on all SUSE Linux Enterprise versions were originally affected. 
    The problem is inherent to the existing SSH v2 protocol, so new protocol addition(s) and enforcement 
    of them are needed to avoid the problem.</para>
   
   <para>The protocol vulnerability needs to be exploited in tandem with specific SSH ciphers.     
    The <package>chacha20-poly1305</package> SSH cipher is the one that was shown to be exploitable 
    most easily, also other ciphers using Encrypt-Then-MAC Message Authentication Codes (MACs) might 
    be exploitable under certain conditions.</para>

   <title>TTY injection via sudo</title>

   <bridgehead>Overview</bridgehead>
   <para> The Linux TTY subsystem allows pushing back keypresses into the TTY stack. 
   This is a not well-known feature and may lead to unexpected consequences or potential attacks.
   As an example, in cases where untrusted code using a command such as <command>sudo</command> 
    is executed, the untrusted code could push keypresses into the TTY stack, 
    which could then be executed after the <command>sudo</command> execution completes.</para>
   
   <para>While <command>sudo</command> is commonly used for transitioning to <quote>root</quote>
    where this would not be an issue, other <command>sudo</command> scenarios are possible where this could be used to escalate privileges.
    The untrusted code would then be able to execute commands as <quote>root</quote> using this attack.</para>
   
   <para>To avoid this injection, <command>sudo</command> has the option to create a new 
    pseudo terminal device (PTY), which is discarded after running <command>sudo</command>, 
    and would not be affected by this keypress push back attack. However, note that this might impact 
    terminal output or the use of interactive keys like backspace or delete.</para>

  <para>The SUSE Solution Security team constantly monitors all the software components used in our

   such as buffer overflow, denial of service, or unwanted elevated access. It is clear that developers are 
   becoming more and more security-aware and that the quality of the code being developed has improved 
   significantly, both in quantity and quality. While we are seeing an increasing number of important

  <title>What’s new in 2024: An increased amount of reported kernel security vulnerabilities </title>
  
  <para>In 2024, the National Vulnerability Database (NVD) experienced a significant surge in reported security 
   vulnerabilities. This increase is largely attributed to the Linux kernel team, which, via its own CVE Numbering 
   Authority (CNA),    has recently begun issuing CVEs for a broader range of kernel issues. Their inclusive approach, 
   covering diverse kernel use-cases from embedded systems to enterprise deployments, results in the issuance of 
   many CVEs that do not impact SUSE Linux product usage. Nonetheless, SUSE engineers addressed over 4,000 unique 
   CVEs affecting various kernel versions in 2024.</para>
  
  <para>A significant number of allocated CVEs do not pose an exploitable risk within SUSE Linux kernels. 
  In alignment with industry standards, SUSE will not address CVEs falling under the following categories:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>Code SUSE does not build into its kernels</para>
    <para>CVEs targeting code that is not enabled in SUSE kernels through CONFIG options. That includes drivers 
     which are not enabled but also debugging code like VM_BUG_ON etc.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Testing infrastructure</para>
    <para>Fixes for tools or test scenarios that are not meant to be run on production systems.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>WARN_ON fixes</para>
    <para>SUSE default and recommended configurations, which only trigger warnings due to disabled 
     <command>panic_on_warn</command>.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Small GFP_KERNEL allocation failures triggering <emphasis role="strong">NULL ptr</emphasis></para>
    <para>Fixes adding allocation failure checks to prevent from NULL ptr crashes for very small allocations. 
     If the allocation request is GFP_KERNEL and the allocation size is small (&lt;= PAGE_ALLOC_COSTLY_ORDER) then an allocation failure is practically impossible. This means that those fixes are never tested and therefore risky to introduce unwanted side effects which would be harder to notice. The benefit of the fix is therefore much smaller than the risk fixing it might cause.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para><package>debugfs</package> only fixes</para>
    <para><package>debugfs</package>, a kernel debugging interface, lacks the rigorous API/ABI scrutiny applied to 
     other kernel functionalities. Consequently, enabling <package>debugfs</package> is discouraged, especially on 
     production systems. If required, access should be strictly limited to privileged users. On SUSE systems, 
     <package>debugfs</package> access is restricted to root only.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Boot time crashes</para>
    <para>Fixes for boot time crashes, either as a result of an unexpected HW configuration (LPAR configurations, 
     device tree misconfiguration, BIOS/FW bugs) or as a result of kernel command line misconfiguration.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Memory leaks which cannot be directly triggered from the userspace</para>
    <para>CVEs assigned for memory leaks which are either impractical to trigger (for example, clean up not done 
     on module unloading) or on a failure path which is not controllable by an attacker.</para>
   </listitem>
   <listitem>
    <para>Hardware-specific failure trigger</para>
    <para>kernel crashes triggered by a HW failure are not considered a security threat unless they can be directly 
     triggered by a user.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>Note that some failure modes are generally not recoverable and the only effective protection is 
   physical inaccessibility (for example, storage connectivity) but there are use cases which are primarily focused 
   on the 3rd party HW controlled by potential attacker (for example, USB stick kiosk). The latter is considered a 
   real security attack vector while the former is not.</para>
  
  <para>SUSE will also decide on a case-by-case basis about:</para>
  
  <itemizedlist>
   <listitem>
    <para>Issues triggered solely by system root/CAP_SYSADMIN</para>
    <para>If a crash/use after free(UAF) or similar issue is only triggered by a privileged user, those fixes are not 
     considered security relevant because such a user can already compromise the security of the system. 
     This would include interfaces like fault injection (for example, HW poisoning), sysctl/sysfs/proc configurations 
     that might trigger crashes/UAF etc, kernel modules loading and unloading and many others.</para>
   </listitem>
  </itemizedlist>
  
  <para>For untrusted root scenarios (kernel lockdown, for example in secure boot) issues which allow to bypass lockdown, 
  constraints are considered security relevant.</para>
  
  <para>Issues which SUSE will not fix are marked as <quote>Won't Fix</quote> on the SUSE CVE web pages.</para>

   <title>SUSE received first FIPS 140-3 cryptographic certificates</title>
   
   <para>After several years of work the NIST CMVP agency has improved upon the existing FIPS 140-2 certification 
    and established the FIPS 140-3 certification. The new standard brings many changes which are described in the 
    <emphasis role="bold">Implementation Guidance</emphasis>. They implemented new cryptographic primitive 
    lifecycle requirements and expanded self-test capabilities. Furthermore, they enhanced memory integrity and 
    streamlined the certification process.</para>
   
   <para>SUSE was the first Linux Vendor to receive FIPS 140-3 certificates for its cryptographic modules, based on 
   SUSE Linux Enterprise 15 SP4 and related products.</para>

   <title>Adoption of SELinux in openSUSE Tumbleweed, SUSE Linux Micro 6.x and SUSE Linux Enterprise 16</title>
   
   <para>We recently announced that for openSUSE Tumbleweed, the default mandatory access control (MAC) system 
    selected by the installer will be switched from AppArmor to SELinux in enforcing mode. Additionally, the 
    openSUSE Tumbleweed minimalVM is shipped with SELinux in enforcing mode. </para>
   
   <para>Users installing openSUSE Tumbleweed via the ISO image will see SELinux in enforcing mode as default option 
    in the installer. If the user prefers to use AppArmor instead of SELinux, they are able to change the selection to 
    AppArmor manually in the installer.</para>
   
   <para>AppArmor continues to be excellently maintained by Christian Boltz (@cboltz) as before.</para>
   
   <para>Existing installations using AppArmor will <emphasis role="strong">not</emphasis> be migrated. 
    In case the user wishes to migrate manually to SELinux, a guide is provided on the openSUSE wiki in the Reference 
    links below.</para>
   
   <para>Following this model in our enterprise grade solutions, we have switched to SELinux in our 
    SUSE Linux Micro 6.x family and we will be using SELinux as the default MAC system in the upcoming release of 
    SUSE Linux Enterprise 16. </para>
