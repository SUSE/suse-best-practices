Creating new RKE2 clusters is very easy when using {rancher}.


Go to the home menu of your {rancher} instance.
Click the "Create" button on the right hand side of the screen, as it's shown here:

The window will show you the available options to create new Kubernetes clusters.
Make sure that the toggle button on the right side of the screen is set to RKE2/K3s as shown below:

If you want to create Kubernetes clusters on existing (virtual) machines, choose the "Custom" option at the very bottom, as shown in the picture below:

Next, you'll see a window to configure your Kubernetes cluster. It will look similar to the image below:

Here, you'll need to name the cluster. The name will only be used within {rancher} and won't affect your workloads.
In the next step, make sure to select a Kubernetes version that is supported by the workload you want to deploy.

If you don't have any further requirements to Kubernetes, you can click the "Create" button at the very bottom.
In any other cases talk to your administrators before making adjustements.

Once you've clicked the "Create" button, you should see a screen like this:

In the first step here, select the roles your node(s) should receive.
A common high avaiability setup holds:

* 3 x etcd / controll plane nodes
* 3 x worker nodes

The next step is to copy the registration command to the target machines shell and execute it.
If your {rancher} instance does hold a self-signed certifcate, make sure to tick in the checkbox below the text bar holding the registration command.

You can run the command on all nodes in parallel and don't have to wait until a single node is down.
Once all machines are registered, you can see the cluster status at the top, changing from "updating" to "active".
At this point in time, your Kubernetes cluster is ready to be used.
