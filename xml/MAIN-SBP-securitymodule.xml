            <para>For some time now, governmental agencies around the
                world, such as the United States National Institute of
                Standards and Technology (NIST) (<link
                    xlink:href="http://nvlpubs.nist.gov/nistpubs/SpecialPublications/NIST.SP.800-52r1.pdf"
                    >NIST SP 800-52 Rev.1</link>) and the German Bundesamt

                    >BSI TR-02102-2</link>) have issued guidance to use
                Version 1.2 of the Transport Layer Security (TLS)
                cryptographic protocol as a minimum standard for
                encryption. This is primarily important for HTTPS
                encryption of web traffic, although other uses are affected
                as well, such as e-mail. </para>

            <para>Allowing SUSE`s customers to follow this guidance without
                affecting the stability and usability of their systems is
                challenging. In this paper we will be providing some
                background to illustrate those challenges and then show how
                they have been addressed. </para>

        <title>Background</title>
        <para>As the name indicates, SUSE Linux Enterprise is intended for
            use by enterprises. One of the main attributes valued by
            enterprises in software is stability. SUSE achieves this in a
            number of ways, one of which is to not change versions of its
            software packages unless there is no other alternative. When
            SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 became generally available in 2009,
            OpenSSL 0.9.8 was the package included to provide encryption
            for the various other software that used it. </para>

        <para>It was when the requirement for TLS 1.2 came along that a
            conflict arose between that need and the goal of maintaining
            the same software versions, and hence stability. OpenSSL
            version 0.9.8 simply did not provide an implementation of TLS
            1.1 or 1.2 and never would provide it. </para>

        <para>In order to provide TLS 1.2 with OpenSSL, SUSE would have to
            provide version 1.0 or higher. Such an update to a more recent
            OpenSSL version would have been nearly impossible, as OpenSSL
            is notoriously incompatible with itself when moving between
            versions. An OpenSSL version upgrade would trigger a rebuild of
            a significant number of other packages in SUSE Linux Enterprise
            11 - and subsequently would require a high number of updates to
            be installed on all our customers` production systems. Worse, a
            version upgrade would break third party applications. This was
            considered unacceptable, so another approach was taken.</para>

        <para>Fortunately, there are cryptographic libraries other than
            OpenSSL, and amongst those it was decided that Mozilla`s
            Network Security Services (<link
                xlink:href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Mozilla/Projects/NSS"
                >NSS</link>) would be the best option: </para>

                    <para>The library is stable and proven to work, as it
                        provides HTTPS support (including TLS) for the

                    <para>An Apache module already exists, which is derived

                        administrators used to mod_ssl. </para>

                    <para>The NSS library is already part of SUSE Linux
                        Enterprise 11, and support for TLS 1.2 can be

                        compatibility.</para>

        </para>

        <para>In late November of 2013, SUSE shipped updated versions of
            libfreebl3, libsoftokn3, mozilla-nspr, and mozilla-nss, along
            with a new package apache2-mod_nss in the maintenance channels
            for SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 Service Pack (SP) 2 and SP3. While
            this took care of the web server and web browser cases, it did
            not do the same for other network services such as e-mail or
            tools such as wget and curl.</para>
    </sect1>

    <sect1 xml:id="sec.challenges">
        <title>More Challenges</title>

        <para>The e-mail server that is included with SUSE Linux
            Enterprise, Postfix, does not work with NSS, only with OpenSSL.
            Simply shipping both OpenSSL 0.9.8 and OpenSSL 1.0 was no
            option because it was all too likely that customers would
            install both versions of OpenSSL on their systems. Because of
            the incompatibilities discussed earlier, this would almost
            certainly have lead to all sorts of application crashes. </para>

        <para> The lack of SUSE provided packages built against OpenSSL 1.0
            lead to some customers attempting to recompile them from
            source, with mixed success. Worse, the recompiled packages were
            not supported by SUSE and could affect the supportability for
            the entire system. Further, customers would need some way of
            rebuilding their in-house written applications against OpenSSL
            1.0 to be compliant. Clearly something more was needed.</para>

        <para>In August of 2014, SUSE released the <quote>SUSE Linux
                Enterprise 11 Security Module</quote>, providing
            enhancements to SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 SP3, and later SP4.
            Available to all customers with a SUSE Linux Enterprise Server
            subscription, this allows customers and partners to build TLS
            1.2 compliant infrastructures beyond the HTTPS protocol. The
            packages in the Security Module will be supported in the same
            way and for the same period of time as the other packages
            shipped with SUSE Linux Enterprise 11 <footnote>

        <para> In this context the term <quote>module</quote> can be
            somewhat confusing but it comes from the <quote>optional

            </footnote>. Essentially the Security Module is an additional
            package and maintenance repository for use by YaST or zypper.
            There are no DVDs to order or ISO images to download. At this
            time, there are a total of 31 packages available in the

        <para>For the OpenSSH and Postfix packages, it does not make sense
            to have more than one version installed since they provide a
            service for the entire system, not just for one user or
            application. For the Perl and -devel packages a conflict is
            unavoidable as the header and .so files are in the same
            locations. This means that only the OpenSSL 0.9.8 or the
            OpenSSL 1.0 version of these packages may be installed on a
            given system at one time.</para>

                packages that require all or part of their source code to
                be compiled and linked to these libraries. If the
                corresponding -devel packages from OpenSSL 0.9.8 were never
                installed on a particular system, there should be no need
                to install the OpenSSL 1.0 versions either.</para>

            <para>Because only one set of the development packages can be

                one version and re-installing the other, as needed.</para>

            <para>Depending on what libraries your OpenSSL 1 application
                requires, you might need to also install one or all of the
                following packages:</para>

            </itemizedlist>

            <para>If your application does not require them, then they will
                only be installed if needed by other packages such
                postfix-openssl1, etc.</para>

            <para>These OpenSSL 1 libraries are located in
                    <filename>/opt/suse/lib64</filename> or
                    <filename>/opt/suse/lib</filename> on 32bit systems.
                This allows them to be installed concurrently with the
                OpenSSL 0.9.8 versions. Because they have exactly the same
                file names as the OpenSSL 0.9.8 libraries in
                    <filename>/usr/lib64</filename> and
                    <filename>/usr/lib</filename>, it is important to make
                sure that your software build processes are referencing the
                correct versions.</para>

            <para>The way to accomplish this is by telling the
                compiler/linker where to find the desired version. So, when
                compiling and linking software against OpenSSL 1, pass the
                following parameters to the <userinput>gcc</userinput>
                command:</para>

            <para>
                <userinput>-Wl,-rpath,/opt/suse/lib64</userinput>
            </para>

            <para>or on 32bit systems:</para>

            <para>
                <userinput>-Wl,-rpath,/opt/suse/lib</userinput>
            </para>

            <para>This causes both the application and libraries that are
                built to look for the libraries in
                    <filename>/opt/suse/lib64</filename> or
                    <filename>/opt/suse/lib</filename> first, and in the
                regular system locations later.</para>

            <para>This can most reliably be done by updating whatever
                    <quote>make file</quote> is being used to build the
                software. Note that this must be done for any <emphasis
                    role="strong">libraries</emphasis> being built, as well
                as binary executables. Having a library pointing to the
                wrong version will be just as wrong as having the program
                being executed pointing to the wrong version.</para>

            <para>When compiling and linking against OpenSSL 0.9.8, you
                have a choice; either leave the
                    <userinput>-Wl,-rpath</userinput> out entirely, or
                point to <filename>/usr/lib64</filename> or on 32bit
                systems <filename>/usr/lib</filename>.</para>

            <para>To confirm if your software has been built correctly,
                execute the following command against it:</para>

            <screen>readelf ­a /path/to/your/binaryorlibrary | grep RUNPATH</screen>

            <para>You should see something similar to this example:</para>

            <screen>readelf -a /usr/lib/postfix/smtp | grep RUNPATH
0x000000000000001d (RUNPATH)            Library runpath: [/opt/suse/lib64]</screen>

            <para>To confirm if your application is not referencing any of
                the OpenSSL 0.9.8 libraries, use the
                    <userinput>/usr/bin/ldd</userinput> command as in this
                example:</para>

            <screen>ldd /usr/lib/postfix/smtp | grep /libssl.so.0
ldd /usr/lib/postfix/smtp | grep /libcrypto.so.0</screen>

            <para>You should not see any output from either of those
                commands when run against your application files. If you
                do, it means that your application was linked against the
                wrong version of OpenSSL and you need to reexamine your
                build processes.</para>
